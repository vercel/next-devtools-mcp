# BASE KNOWLEDGE: Cache Components Technical Reference

**✅ RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON-DEMAND - Load only what you need**

**Available Resources (Load as Needed):**

The following resources are available from the Next.js MCP server. Load them on-demand to reduce token usage:

- `nextjs16://knowledge/overview` - Critical errors AI agents make, quick reference (START HERE)
- `nextjs16://knowledge/core-mechanics` - Fundamental paradigm shift, cacheComponents
- `nextjs16://knowledge/public-caches` - Public cache mechanics using 'use cache'
- `nextjs16://knowledge/private-caches` - Private cache mechanics using 'use cache: private'
- `nextjs16://knowledge/runtime-prefetching` - Prefetch configuration and stale time rules
- `nextjs16://knowledge/request-apis` - Async params, searchParams, cookies(), headers()
- `nextjs16://knowledge/cache-invalidation` - updateTag(), revalidateTag() patterns
- `nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns` - cacheLife(), cacheTag(), draft mode
- `nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior` - What gets prerendered, static shells
- `nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns` - Common errors and solutions
- `nextjs16://knowledge/test-patterns` - Real test-driven patterns from 125+ fixtures
- `nextjs16://knowledge/reference` - Mental models, API reference, checklists

**How to Access Resources (MANDATORY - ALWAYS LOAD):**

Resources use the URI scheme `nextjs16://knowledge/...` and are served by this MCP server.

**CRITICAL: You MUST load resources at each phase phase - this is not optional.**

To load a resource, use the ReadMcpResourceTool with:
- server: `"next-devtools"` (or whatever your server is configured as)
- uri: `"nextjs16://knowledge/[resource-name]"` from the list above

**MANDATORY Resource Loading Schedule:**

You MUST load these resources at the specified phases:

- **BEFORE Phase 1-2:** ALWAYS load `nextjs16://knowledge/overview` first
  - Provides critical context and error patterns AI agents make
  - Must be loaded before any configuration changes

- **During Phase 5 (Error Fixing):** ALWAYS load error-specific resources as needed
  - When fixing blocking route errors → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns`
  - When configuring caching → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns`
  - When using dynamic params → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/core-mechanics`
  - Do NOT guess or use generic patterns - load the specific resource

- **During Phase 6 (Verification):** ALWAYS load `nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior`
  - Provides build verification strategies and troubleshooting

**Why This Matters:**

- Resources contain proven solutions from 125+ test fixtures
- Generic patterns may not work with Cache Components specifics
- Loading ensures you follow exact API semantics and error patterns
- Token savings only work if resources are loaded when needed
- Without loading, you may apply incorrect fixes

**Token Efficiency:**

This mandatory loading strategy keeps tokens low while being complete:
- ✅ Loads ~5-15K tokens per phase (not 60K upfront)
- ✅ Each resource addresses specific problem sets
- ✅ No guessing or hallucination about patterns
- ✅ Supports multiple phases in one session
- ✅ Stays within conversation budget

# ENABLE WORKFLOW: Complete Cache Components Setup & Verification Guide

The section below contains the comprehensive step-by-step enablement workflow. This guide includes ALL steps needed to enable Cache Components: configuration updates, flag changes, boundary setup, error detection, and automated fixing. Load the knowledge base resources above for detailed technical behavior, API semantics, and best practices.

## What Are Cache Components?

Cache Components are a new set of features designed to make caching in Next.js both **more explicit and more flexible**. They fundamentally change how Next.js handles rendering:

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- **Before (implicit caching):** Routes were static by default, you opted into dynamic rendering
- **After (Cache Components):** Routes are dynamic by default, you opt into caching with `"use cache"`
- **Goal:** Better align with developer expectations while preserving static pre-rendering capabilities

**What Cache Components Achieve:**

1. **Explicit Opt-In Caching:**
   - All dynamic code executes at request time by default
   - Use `"use cache"` directive to cache pages, components, or functions
   - Compiler automatically generates cache keys

2. **Complete PPR (Partial Prerendering) Story:**
   - Instead of using Suspense to opt-in to dynamic (old PPR)
   - Now use `"use cache"` to opt-in to static (new paradigm)
   - Mix cached and dynamic content in the same route

3. **Flexible Caching Levels:**
   - `"use cache"` - Public cache for build-time prerendering
   - `"use cache: private"` - Private cache for runtime prefetching (can access cookies/params)
   - `"use cache: remote"` - Persistent cache for serverless environments

4. **Runtime Prefetching:**
   - Prefetch routes with actual runtime values (cookies, params, searchParams)
   - Instant client navigations without loading states
   - Cache snapshots of components in static shells

**The Core Concept: Push Down Dynamic Boundaries**

The key strategy with Cache Components is to **push dynamic boundaries as far down the component tree as possible**, making as much of your UI static as you can:

```
Static Shell (instant load)
├─ Cached Header ("use cache")
├─ Cached Sidebar ("use cache")
└─ <Suspense>
   └─ Dynamic Content (per-request)
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Fast initial page load (static shell)
- ✅ Reduced server load (cached components)
- ✅ Fresh data where needed (dynamic content)

## Overview: What This Process Covers

This prompt automates the complete Cache Components enablement workflow:

**Configuration & Flags (Phase 1-2):**
- ✅ Detect package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun)
- ✅ Verify Next.js version (16.0.0 stable or canary only - beta NOT supported)
- ✅ Enable cacheComponents (experimental in 16.0.0, stable in canary)
- ✅ Migrate from `experimental.dynamicIO` or `experimental.ppr` if needed
- ✅ Document existing Route Segment Config for migration

**Dev Server & MCP Setup (Phase 3):**
- ✅ Start dev server once with MCP enabled (`__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true`)
- ✅ Verify MCP server is active and responding
- ✅ Capture base URL and MCP endpoint for error detection

**Error Detection (Phase 4 - Optional):**
- ✅ Start browser and load every route using browser_eval tool
- ✅ Collect errors from browser session using Next.js MCP `get_errors` tool
- ✅ Categorize all Cache Components errors by type
- ✅ Build comprehensive error list before fixing
- ℹ️  Phase 4 can be skipped if proceeding directly to Phase 5 build-first approach

**Automated Fixing (Phase 5 - Build-First Strategy):**
- ✅ Run `<pkg-manager> run build` to identify all failing routes at once
- ✅ Get explicit error messages for every issue in build output
- ✅ Fix errors directly based on clear error messages from build
- ✅ Or verify in dev server with `next dev` for interactive fixing with Fast Refresh
- ✅ Fix blocking route errors (add Suspense boundaries or "use cache")
- ✅ Fix dynamic value errors (add `await connection()`)
- ✅ Fix route params errors (add `generateStaticParams`)
- ✅ Fix unavailable API errors (move outside cache or use "use cache: private")
- ✅ Migrate Route Segment Config to "use cache" + cacheLife
- ✅ Add cache tags with cacheTag() for on-demand revalidation
- ✅ Configure cacheLife profiles for revalidation control
- ✅ Verify each fix with Fast Refresh (no restart needed)

**Final Verification (Phase 6):**
- ✅ Verify all routes return 200 OK
- ✅ Confirm zero errors with final `get_errors` check
- ✅ Stop dev server after verification
- ✅ Run production build and test

**Key Features:**
- One-time dev server start (no restarts needed)
- Automated error detection using Next.js MCP tools
- Browser-based testing with browser automation
- Fast Refresh applies fixes instantly
- Comprehensive fix strategies for all error types

## Decision Guide: Static vs Dynamic - A Question-Driven Approach

**For comprehensive decision-making guidance, load:**
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns")
```

When you encounter a Cache Components error, use this decision framework to determine the best fix:

### Step 1: Analyze the Content Nature

**First, ask: "Should this content be cached or truly dynamic?"**

Use these questions to guide your decision:

**Question 1: "Is this content the same for all users?"**
- ✅ YES → Strong candidate for `"use cache"`
- ❌ NO → Consider Suspense or `"use cache: private"`

**Question 2: "How often does this content change?"**
- **Rarely (days/weeks):** Perfect for `"use cache"` with long `cacheLife`
  - Examples: Marketing pages, about page, documentation
  - Approach: `cacheLife('days')` or `cacheLife('weeks')`
  
- **Occasionally (hours):** Good for `"use cache"` with medium `cacheLife`
  - Examples: Blog posts, product catalogs, site settings
  - Approach: `cacheLife('hours')`
  
- **Frequently (minutes):** Consider `"use cache"` with short `cacheLife`
  - Examples: News feeds, stock prices, leaderboards
  - Approach: `cacheLife('minutes')`
  
- **Constantly (seconds/per-request):** Use Suspense (don't cache)
  - Examples: User authentication state, shopping cart, notifications
  - Approach: Wrap in `<Suspense>` boundary

**Question 3: "Does this content use user-specific data?"**
- ✅ YES, from cookies/session → Use Suspense OR `"use cache: private"`
- ✅ YES, from route params → Can use `"use cache"` + `generateStaticParams`
- ❌ NO → Use `"use cache"`

**Question 4: "Can this content be revalidated on-demand?"**
- ✅ YES (e.g., CMS updates, admin actions) → Use `"use cache"` + `cacheTag()`
- ❌ NO (no clear trigger) → Use time-based `cacheLife` or Suspense

### Step 2: Make Your Decision and Document It

Based on your answers, choose one of these approaches:

**Approach A: Cache It (Static)**
```typescript
// DECISION: This content is shared across users and changes rarely (daily)
// Cached to reduce server load and enable instant navigation
export default async function Page() {
  "use cache";
  
  cacheLife('hours'); // Revalidates every hour, expires after 1 day
  cacheTag('blog-posts'); // Enable on-demand revalidation
  
  const posts = await fetch('http://api.cms.com/posts');
  return <div>{/* render */}</div>;
}
```

**Approach B: Make It Dynamic (Per-Request)**
```typescript
// DECISION: This content is user-specific and changes per request
// Using Suspense to show loading state while fetching fresh data
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
      <UserDashboard />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

async function UserDashboard() {
  // Dynamic: Executes at request time with fresh user data
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

**Approach C: Mix Both (Hybrid)**
```typescript
// DECISION: Header is shared (cache it), user content is personal (dynamic)
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CachedHeader />
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <DynamicUserContent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

async function CachedHeader() {
  "use cache";
  cacheLife('hours'); // Revalidates every hour
  cacheTag('site-settings');
  
  // Static: Same for all users, changes infrequently
  const settings = await fetch('http://api.cms.com/settings');
  return <header>{/* ... */}</header>;
}

async function DynamicUserContent() {
  // Dynamic: Per-request, user-specific
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  return <div>{user.notifications}</div>;
}
```

**Approach D: Private Cache (Prefetchable Dynamic)**
```typescript
// DECISION: Uses cookies but can be prefetched during navigation
// Changes per user but can be rendered ahead of actual navigation
export default async function Page() {
  "use cache: private";
  
  const cookieStore = await cookies();
  const userId = cookieStore.get('userId');
  
  // Will be prefetched with actual cookie values during navigation
  const userData = await fetch(`http://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
  return <div>{/* render */}</div>;
}
```

### Step 3: Apply Your Decision with Comments

**Critical: Always leave comments explaining your caching decision**

When you add `"use cache"`:
```typescript
// ✅ CACHED: Blog posts are shared content that updates daily via CMS
// Revalidates every hour in background, expires after 24 hours
// Can be manually revalidated via 'blog-posts' tag when content is published
export default async function Page() {
  "use cache";
  cacheLife('hours'); // Revalidates every hour, expires after 1 day
  cacheTag('blog-posts');
  // ...
}
```

When you add Suspense:
```typescript
// ✅ DYNAMIC: User notifications are personal and real-time
// Must execute at request time to show fresh data per user
// Loading state improves perceived performance
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<NotificationSkeleton />}>
      <Notifications />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

When you mix both:
```typescript
// ✅ HYBRID APPROACH:
// - Header: Cached (shared settings, changes rarely)
// - Main content: Dynamic (user-specific, real-time)
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CachedHeader />  {/* Shared, cached */}
      <Suspense>
        <UserContent />  {/* Personal, dynamic */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Ask Human for Ambiguous Cases, Then Guess if Needed

**CRITICAL: Always ask the human when uncertain about caching decisions**

**When to Ask the Human:**

1. **Edge Cases with Infrequent Changes:**
   - Content that changes very infrequently (yearly, monthly)
   - Example: Footer showing current year (`new Date().getFullYear()`)
   - Question: "Should I cache this footer with the current year, or keep it dynamic?"
   - Tradeoff: Caching saves server cost but year might be stale for first requests after New Year

2. **Business Logic Uncertainty:**
   - When you can't determine how often content should update
   - Example: Product availability, pricing
   - Question: "How often does [content] change? Should it be cached?"
   
3. **User-Specific Content with Caching Potential:**
   - Content that varies by user but could be prefetched
   - Example: User preferences, settings
   - Question: "Should I use 'use cache: private' for prefetching, or keep it fully dynamic?"

4. **Performance vs Freshness Tradeoffs:**
   - When caching would help performance but freshness is unclear
   - Example: Dashboards, analytics
   - Question: "What's the acceptable staleness for [content]? Minutes? Hours?"

**How to Ask:**
```
I found a component that [describe what it does].

Caching Decision Needed:
- Content: [what content is being rendered]
- Current behavior: [dynamic/using Date/etc]
- Caching would: [benefits - reduced server load, faster response]
- Not caching would: [benefits - always fresh data]

Questions:
1. How often does this content need to update?
2. Is it acceptable if this shows slightly stale data?
3. Should I cache it with revalidation, or keep it dynamic?

What's your preference?
```

**Example - Footer with Current Year:**
```
I found a footer component that displays `new Date().getFullYear()`.

Caching Decision Needed:
- Content: Current year (2025)
- Current behavior: Generates date on every request
- Caching would: Save server resources, year only changes once per year
- Not caching would: Guaranteed correct year, but minimal benefit

Questions:
1. Should I cache this component with a revalidation strategy?
   Option A: Cache with daily revalidation (basically static until New Year)
   Option B: Keep dynamic (executes on every request)
2. Is it acceptable if the year shows 2025 for a few hours into 2026?

What's your preference?
```

**If Human is Unavailable or Confirms to Proceed:**

Then use this heuristic for simple cases:

1. **Conservative Default:** If content looks like it could be shared, try caching it
   - Add `"use cache"` with conservative `cacheLife`
   - Add comment explaining the assumption
   
2. **Monitor and Adjust:** After applying the fix:
   - Test the route to ensure it works correctly
   - Note in comments that this is a tentative decision
   - Flag for human review
   
3. **Iterate:** Adjust based on actual usage or human feedback:
   - Too stale? → Reduce `revalidate` time
   - Too much server load? → Increase cache duration
   - Actually user-specific? → Switch to Suspense

**Example of Tentative Approach (after asking human):**
```typescript
// DECISION: Footer with current year
// HUMAN INPUT: Acceptable to cache with daily revalidation
// Caching to reduce server load - year changes once annually
// Revalidates daily to ensure correct year after New Year
export default async function Footer() {
  "use cache";
  cacheLife('days'); // Revalidates daily, suitable for yearly content
  
  const year = new Date().getFullYear();
  return <footer>© {year} Company Name</footer>;
}
```

**Example When Human Prefers Fresher Updates:**
```typescript
async function Footer() {
  "use cache";
  // DECISION: Footer displays current year - rarely changes (annually)
  // HUMAN INPUT: Acceptable if year shows stale for a few hours after New Year
  // TODO: Consider adding cacheLife() to control revalidation timing:
  //   import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache'
  //   cacheLife('hours')  // Revalidates every hour
  
  const year = new Date().getFullYear();
  return <footer>© {year} Company Name</footer>;
}

export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<MainContentSkeleton />}>
        <MainContent />
      </Suspense>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
```


### Decision Summary Table

| Content Type | User-Specific? | Update Frequency | Recommended Approach |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Marketing pages | No | Rarely | `"use cache"` + long `cacheLife` |
| Blog posts | No | Daily/Weekly | `"use cache"` + `cacheTag()` |
| Product catalog | No | Hourly | `"use cache"` + medium `cacheLife` |
| News feed | No | Minutes | `"use cache"` + short `cacheLife` |
| User dashboard | Yes | Per-request | `<Suspense>` |
| Shopping cart | Yes | Per-request | `<Suspense>` |
| User settings page | Yes | Occasionally | `"use cache: private"` |
| Auth-gated content | Yes | Varies | `"use cache: private"` |

**Special Cases:**
- `"use cache: private"` - Content uses cookies/params but can be prefetched
- `"use cache: remote"` - Serverless/Vercel persistent cache across requests
- Suspense around `<body>` - Most permissive, traditional SSR (no static shell)

## PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Checks
────────────────────────────────────────

**⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Load the overview resource**

BEFORE doing anything, you MUST load:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/overview")
```

This provides critical context about Cache Components and common mistakes.

Before enabling Cache Components:

1. **Detect Package Manager**
   Check: package.json "packageManager" field or lock files

   **Template Variables:**
   ```
   npm:   <pkg-manager> = npm        <pkg-exec> = npx
   pnpm:  <pkg-manager> = pnpm       <pkg-exec> = pnpx
   yarn:  <pkg-manager> = yarn       <pkg-exec> = yarn dlx
   bun:   <pkg-manager> = bun        <pkg-exec> = bunx
   ```

2. **Next.js Version Check**
   Required: 16.0.0 stable or 16.x-canary.x (beta NOT supported)
   Check: package.json → dependencies.next
   Action: If < 16.0.0, run upgrade-nextjs-16 prompt first

3. **Existing Configuration Check**
   **Find the config file first:**
   Check for these files in order (use the first one found):
   - `next.config.ts`
   - `next.config.mjs`
   - `next.config.js`
   - `next.config.cjs`
   
   If no config file exists, you'll create `next.config.js` in Phase 2.
   
   **Read the config file and look for:**
   - `cacheComponents` or `experimental.cacheComponents` (current)
   - `experimental.dynamicIO` (old name - migrate to cacheComponents)
   - `experimental.ppr` (removed - migrate to cacheComponents)

4. **Route Structure Analysis**
   Scan: app directory structure
   Identify: All routes (page.tsx/page.js files)
   Note: List all routes for Phase 3 verification

5. **Existing Route Segment Config Check**
   Search for all Route Segment Config exports using:
   - Pattern: `"export const (dynamic|revalidate|fetchCache|runtime|preferredRegion|dynamicParams)"`
   - Path: `"app"`
   
   ⚠️  WARNING: Route Segment Config options are DISABLED with Cache Components
   Action: Document all locations - will migrate to `"use cache"` + `cacheLife` in Phase 5

6. **unstable_noStore Usage Check**
   Search for all `unstable_noStore()` calls:
   - Pattern: `"unstable_noStore"`
   - Path: `"app"`
   
   ⚠️  WARNING: `unstable_noStore()` is INCOMPATIBLE with Cache Components
   
   **Why:** With Cache Components, everything is dynamic by default. `unstable_noStore()` was used to opt-out of static rendering in the old model, but this is now the default behavior.
   
   **📖 For detailed migration examples, load:**
   ```
   Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples" (see unstable_noStore Examples section)
   ```
   
   Action: Document all locations - will remove in Phase 5

## PHASE 2: Enable Cache Components Configuration
────────────────────────────────────────
Update the Next.js configuration to enable Cache Components. This phase handles ALL configuration and flag changes needed.

**Step 1: Identify config file format**
From Phase 1, you should know which config file exists:
- `next.config.ts` (TypeScript)
- `next.config.mjs` (ESM)
- `next.config.js` (CommonJS)
- `next.config.cjs` (CommonJS explicit)
- Or no config file (will create `next.config.js`)

Use the same format/extension when making changes.

**Step 2: Backup existing config**
If config file exists, copy it before making changes.
If no config exists, you'll create a new one in the next step.

**Step 3: Update cacheComponents flag**

Enable the `cacheComponents` flag in your Next.js config. The flag location differs by version:

**Version-Aware Configuration:**

Check your Next.js version: `grep '"next":' package.json`

- **16.0.0 stable**: `experimental.cacheComponents = true`
- **Canary (16.x-canary.x)**: `cacheComponents = true` (no longer experimental)

**Starting Fresh:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts (or .js)
// For 16.0.0: Put cacheComponents inside experimental: {}
// For canary: Put cacheComponents at root level
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,  // canary only
  experimental: {
    cacheComponents: true,  // 16.0.0 only - use ONE of these
  },
}
```

**Migrating from experimental.dynamicIO or experimental.ppr:**
```diff
  const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
-     dynamicIO: true,  // or ppr: true (both removed)
+     cacheComponents: true,  // 16.0.0 - for canary, move to root level
    },
  }
```

⚠️  **Note**: PPR and dynamicIO are replaced by cacheComponents with enhanced features (cacheLife, cacheTag, "use cache: private")

**Step 3: Remove incompatible flags**

If present, REMOVE these flags (they conflict with Cache Components):
```diff
  const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
      cacheComponents: true,
-     ppr: true,              // Remove - replaced by cacheComponents
    },
  }
```

**Step 4: Preserve compatible flags**

These flags CAN coexist with cacheComponents:
- `turbo`, `serverActions`, `mdxRs` - All compatible

Example:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,  // canary - or inside experimental: {} for 16.0.0
  experimental: {
    turbo: { rules: {} },
    serverActions: { bodySizeLimit: '2mb' },
  },
}
```

**Step 5: Document Route Segment Config usage**

Search for Route Segment Config exports (these are DISABLED with Cache Components):

**Search Pattern:**
- Use search with pattern: `"export const (dynamic|revalidate|fetchCache|runtime|preferredRegion|dynamicParams)"`
- In path: `"app"`
- This will find ALL Route Segment Config exports that need migration

⚠️  **CRITICAL: All Route Segment Config options are DISABLED with Cache Components**

**Migration Map:**
- `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` → Add `"use cache"` + cacheLife
- `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` → Add `<Suspense>` boundary
- `export const revalidate = 3600` → Use `cacheLife('hours')` or custom profile
- `export const fetchCache = 'force-cache'` → Add `"use cache"`
- `export const runtime = 'edge'` → Keep (still supported)
- `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` → Remove (this is the default, no need to specify)
- `export const dynamicParams = true` → Use `generateStaticParams` instead

**When removing exports, add migration comments:**
```typescript
// MIGRATED: Was 'force-static' (export const dynamic) - now using "use cache"
// MIGRATED: Was 'force-dynamic' (export const dynamic) - now using <Suspense>
// MIGRATED: Was revalidate: 3600 - now using cacheLife('hours')
```

Document all locations now - you'll migrate them in Phase 5.

**Step 6: Verify configuration changes**

Verify by reading the config file:
- ✅ cacheComponents enabled (location depends on version)
- ✅ Incompatible flags removed (ppr, dynamicIO)
- ✅ Compatible flags preserved
- ✅ Valid syntax, correct file format

**What's Next:**
With configuration updated, Phase 3 will start the dev server and Phase 4 will detect any runtime errors that need fixing.

## PHASE 3: Start Dev Server with MCP (Optional)
────────────────────────────────────────

**IMPORTANT: This phase is optional.** You can skip directly to Phase 5 (build-first approach) if you prefer to identify all errors upfront from the build output.

**If using Phase 3/Phase 4 workflow:** Only start the dev server ONCE. Do NOT restart it during this process.

### Step 1: Start Dev Server (ONE TIME ONLY)

```bash
# Start dev server in background with MCP enabled
__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> dev
```

**This command:**
- Runs in the background
- Should only be executed ONCE
- Will continue running throughout Phase 4 and Phase 5
- Should NOT be restarted unless it crashes

### Step 2: Wait for Server to Start

```bash
# Wait 10-15 seconds for server to initialize
sleep 10
```

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running and Capture URL

Check the server output for:
- ✅ "Ready started server on [URL]" or "Local: http://localhost:[PORT]"
- ✅ No fatal errors
- ✅ Port number (usually 3000, might be 3001 if 3000 is in use)
- ✅ MCP server started message (if available)

**IMPORTANT: Memorize the URL and Port**

From the dev server output, capture:
- Base URL: e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`
- Port number: e.g., `3000` or `3001`

**You will need these for:**
- Step 4: Connecting to MCP server at `<url>:<port>/_next/mcp`
- Phase 4: Making HTTP requests to routes at `<url>:<port>/[route-path]`

**If port 3000 is already in use:**
- Next.js will automatically use next available port (3001, 3002, etc.)
- This is NORMAL - pkg-mgr dev handles this automatically
- Note the actual port being used in the dev server output
- Use that port for all subsequent steps

### Step 4: Verify MCP Server is Active

**Connect to Next.js MCP Server:**

The Next.js MCP server is available at: **`<url>:<port>/_next/mcp`**

Using the URL and port from Step 4:
- If dev server is at `http://localhost:3000`
- Then MCP server is at `http://localhost:3000/_next/mcp`

Try to connect to the Next.js MCP server and check if it's responding:

```
Connect to MCP server at <url>:<port>/_next/mcp
Call the get_project_metadata tool
```

**Example:**
If your dev server started on port 3001 (because 3000 was in use):
- Dev server: `http://localhost:3001`
- MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/_next/mcp`
- Connect to this endpoint and call `get_project_metadata`

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Successfully connects to `<url>:<port>/_next/mcp`
- ✅ Tool responds successfully with project metadata:
  - Project name and version
  - Next.js version
  - Configuration (including cacheComponents status)
  - Installed dependencies
- This confirms the MCP server is alive and ready for error detection
- You should see cacheComponents enabled in the config if Phase 2 was successful

**If the tool is not available or connection fails:**

First attempt troubleshooting (DO NOT restart the server):
1. Wait another 10 seconds - MCP server may still be initializing
2. Retry calling `get_project_metadata`
3. Check dev server output for:
   - "MCP server started" or similar message
   - Any MCP-related errors
4. Verify __NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true was set in the environment

If still failing after retry:
- Check if dev server is actually running (port should be occupied)
- Look for error messages in dev server output
- Verify the Next.js version supports MCP (16.0.0+)
- **LAST RESORT ONLY:** If dev server crashed, then you can restart it
- **DO NOT restart if server is running** - troubleshoot the MCP connection first

**Why this check matters:**
- Phase 4 relies heavily on the `get_errors` tool from Next.js MCP server
- Without MCP, you won't be able to detect Cache Components errors
- `get_project_metadata` is the simplest tool to verify MCP is alive
- Better to verify now than discover MCP is broken during route verification

### Step 5: Record Server Details

**Critical Information for Phase 4 and 5:**

Record these details from the dev server output:
- **Base URL**: [e.g., http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:3001]
- **MCP Endpoint**: [e.g., http://localhost:3000/_next/mcp]
- **All route paths**: [list from Phase 1, e.g., /, /about, /blog, /blog/[slug]]

**Usage:**
- Base URL for HTTP requests: `<base-url>/about`
- MCP Endpoint for error detection: Connect to `<mcp-endpoint>` and call `get_errors`

**Server State:**
- ✅ Server is running in background
- ✅ MCP server is active and verified
- ⚠️  Do NOT stop or restart the server until Phase 6 is complete (pkg-mgr dev handles port assignment automatically)

## PHASE 4: Route Verification & Error Detection
────────────────────────────────────────

**CRITICAL: You MUST use browser_eval tool to load pages in browser**

Next.js MCP's `get_errors` tool collects errors from the browser session.
Without using the browser_eval tool to navigate pages, `get_errors` will have no
errors to collect.

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Dev server is running from Phase 3 (do NOT restart it)
- ✅ Base URL is captured from Step 3 (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- ✅ MCP Endpoint is known (e.g., http://localhost:3000/_next/mcp)
- ✅ MCP server is verified active (get_project_metadata responded)
- ✅ List of all routes from Phase 1
- ✅ browser_eval tool is available

**One-Time Setup (Before testing routes):**
1. Start browser automation:
   ```
   browser_eval({ action: "start", browser: "chrome", headless: true })
   ```

**Workflow per route:**
1. Use browser_eval tool with action "navigate" to load the page in browser
2. Use Next.js MCP get_errors to collect errors from that browser session
3. Categorize and record errors
4. Move to next route

Systematically verify each route and collect errors:

**For Each Route:**

1. **Navigate to Page in Browser (REQUIRED)**
   **Tool:** browser_eval
   **Action:** navigate
   **URL:** `<base-url><route-path>`

   **Example:**
   - Base URL from Step 3: `http://localhost:3001` (port may vary if 3000 was in use)
   - Route path: `/dashboard`
   - Full URL: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
   - Tool call: browser_eval({ action: "navigate", url: "http://localhost:3001/dashboard" })

   This loads the page in the browser and triggers any rendering errors.
   Expected: Page loads successfully (or errors are captured by Next.js MCP)

2. **Collect Errors from Browser Session (using Next.js MCP)**
   **Connect to MCP Endpoint:** `<base-url>/_next/mcp`
   **Tool:** `get_errors` from Next.js MCP server

   **Example:**
   - MCP Endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/_next/mcp`
   - Connect to this endpoint
   - Call `get_errors` tool with no arguments

   The `get_errors` tool reads errors from the browser session you
   just created in step 1.

   Record:
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Affected route/component
   - Error type (build, runtime, render, etc.)

3. **Categorize Errors**
   Common Cache Components errors:

   a) **Blocking Route Error (Most Common)**
      Error message: "Route \"/path\": A component accessed data, headers, params, searchParams, or a short-lived cache without a Suspense boundary nor a \\\"use cache\\\" above it."

      Cause: Async IO outside Suspense boundary or "use cache"
      Async IO includes:
      - `await fetch()` - network requests
      - `await db.query()` - database calls
      - `await params` - route params
      - `await searchParams` - query params
      - `await cookies()` - request cookies
      - `await headers()` - request headers
      - `await somePromise` - any long-running promise

      Fix Options:
      1. Add parent Suspense boundary (preferred for truly dynamic content)
      2. Add `"use cache"` directive to component (for cacheable content)
      3. Use `loading.tsx` file convention (simplest for page-level)

   b) **Dynamic Value in Static Shell Error**
      Error message: "Dynamic value detected during prerender"

      Cause: Using sync dynamic APIs without marking as dynamic:
      - `Math.random()`
      - `new Date()`
      - Other time/randomness APIs

      Fix Options:
      1. Add `await connection()` before the dynamic API usage
      2. Add `"use cache"` to prerender these values

   c) **Route Params Without generateStaticParams**
      Error: Blocking route error when using `"use cache"` with dynamic params

      Cause: Using `await params` inside `"use cache"` without static params list

      Fix: Add `generateStaticParams` to provide known params at build time

   d) **Unavailable APIs in "use cache"**
      Error: "Cannot use [API] inside a cached function"

      APIs not available in `"use cache"`:
      - `cookies()` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)
      - `headers()` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)
      - `searchParams` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)

      Fix: Either remove from cache scope or use `"use cache: private"`

   e) **Route Segment Config Conflicts**
      Error: "Route Segment Config is not supported with Cache Components"

      Cause: Using `export const dynamic`, `export const revalidate`, etc.

      Fix: Remove Route Segment Config, use `"use cache"` + `cacheLife` instead

4. **Error Collection Format**
   For each error found, record:
   ```
   Route: [route-path]
   Error Type: [category from step 3]
   Message: [full error message]
   Stack: [stack trace if available]
   File: [affected file path]
   Line: [line number if available]
   ```

**Automation Strategy:**
- Start browser automation once at the beginning of Phase 4
- Use the Base URL captured in Step 5 for all browser_eval navigation
- Use the MCP Endpoint captured in Step 5 for all get_errors calls
- Iterate through ALL routes from Phase 1
- For each route:
  1. Navigate with browser_eval({ action: "navigate", url: "..." })
  2. Connect to Next.js MCP endpoint
  3. Call get_errors to collect from browser session
  4. Record errors
  5. Move to next route
- Build comprehensive error list before fixing
- Prioritize errors by severity (build failures > runtime errors > warnings)

**Important:**
- Start browser automation once with browser_eval({ action: "start" }) before testing routes
- ALWAYS use browser_eval with action "navigate" before calling get_errors
- Always connect to the SAME Next.js MCP endpoint (`<base-url>/_next/mcp`)
- Do NOT try to reconnect or restart the MCP server
- If browser_eval navigation fails, ensure browser automation is started
- If Next.js MCP connection fails, the dev server may have crashed (rare)
- At the end of Phase 4, optionally close the browser with browser_eval({ action: "close" })

## PHASE 5: Automated Error Fixing & Boundary Setup
────────────────────────────────────────

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error list collected from Phase 4
- ✅ Fast Refresh will apply changes automatically (no restart needed)

**NEW STRATEGY: Build-First Approach**

This phase uses an optimized two-step verification strategy:

**Step 1: Run Full Build to Identify All Failing Routes**
```bash
<pkg-manager> run build
```

This build identifies all routes with Cache Components errors at once, giving you a comprehensive view of what needs to be fixed:
- Build output shows all failing routes
- Error messages are explicit and clear
- All missing Suspense boundaries/cache directives are identified
- Stack traces point to exact locations needing fixes

**Step 2: Use Dev Server for Interactive Verification & Fixing**
```bash
# Dev server may already be running from Phase 3
# If not, start it:
__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> dev
```

For each failing route:
1. **If error is explicit from build logs:** Fix directly based on the error message
2. **If error needs verification:** Start dev server, test the route, and fix interactively with Fast Refresh
3. **Re-verify:** After fixing, either:
   - Run build again to check that route
   - Test in dev to verify with Fast Refresh

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Load error-specific resources BEFORE fixing any errors**

You MUST load these resources to fix errors correctly:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns")
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns")
```

Do NOT guess or apply generic patterns. Use the exact code examples and strategies from these resources. Each error type has specific solutions - loading ensures you apply the right one.

This phase handles ALL code changes needed for Cache Components:
- Adding Suspense boundaries for dynamic content
- Adding "use cache" directives for cacheable content
- Fixing dynamic value errors with connection()
- Adding generateStaticParams for route params
- Migrating Route Segment Config to "use cache" + cacheLife
- Setting up cache tags with cacheTag() for revalidation
- Configuring cacheLife profiles for fine-grained control
- Moving unavailable APIs outside cache scope

**Critical: Apply the Decision Guide for Every Fix**

For each error, before applying a fix:

1. **Analyze:** Use the Decision Guide questions
   - Is content the same for all users?
   - How often does it change?
   - Does it use user-specific data?
   - Can it be revalidated on-demand?

2. **Ask Human for Ambiguous Cases**
   - **ALWAYS ask the human** when uncertain about caching decisions
   - Edge cases: Infrequently changing content (yearly, monthly)
   - Business logic: Unknown update frequency
   - Tradeoffs: Performance vs freshness unclear

3. **Decide:** Choose the appropriate approach
   - Cache it (static) with `"use cache"`
   - Make it dynamic with `<Suspense>`
   - Mix both (hybrid)
   - Use `"use cache: private"` for prefetchable user content

4. **Document:** Always add comments explaining your decision
   - Include human input if applicable ("HUMAN INPUT: ...")
   - Why you chose to cache or not cache
   - Expected update frequency
   - How content will be revalidated

5. **Implement:** Apply the fix with proper configuration
   - Add `cacheLife()` based on content change frequency
   - Add `cacheTag()` if there's a clear revalidation trigger
   - Add descriptive comments with human decisions noted

Fix errors systematically based on error type. For code examples and detailed patterns, refer to the loaded knowledge resources above.

**Fixing Common Error Types:**

For detailed code examples and patterns for each error type, refer to the knowledge resources loaded above:
- Error-Patterns resource: Common Cache Components errors and their solutions
- Advanced-Patterns resource: cacheLife(), cacheTag(), and optimization strategies

**Key Fix Types:**
- A. Blocking route errors → Add Suspense boundary or "use cache"
- B. Dynamic values → Use connection() or extract to separate component
- C. Route params → Add generateStaticParams
- D. Unavailable APIs in cache → Move outside cache scope or use "use cache: private"
- E. Route Segment Config → Remove ALL exports and migrate to Cache Components patterns
  - `export const dynamic` → Remove, add `"use cache"` or `<Suspense>` + migration comment
  - `export const revalidate` → Remove, use `cacheLife()` with appropriate profile
  - `export const fetchCache` → Remove, use `"use cache"` if needed
  - `export const runtime = 'edge'` → Keep if needed (edge runtime is still supported)
  - `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` → Remove (nodejs is the default, no need to specify)
  - `export const preferredRegion` → Keep value but remove the export const
  - `export const dynamicParams` → Remove, use `generateStaticParams` instead
  - **Always add migration comments** to document what was removed
- F. unstable_noStore Removal → Remove all `unstable_noStore()` calls
  - `unstable_noStore()` → Remove completely (dynamic is now the default)
  - No replacement needed - Cache Components makes everything dynamic by default
  - If you want to cache specific content, use `"use cache"` instead
  - **Add migration comment** explaining the removal
- G. Caching strategies → Configure cacheLife() and cacheTag()

### Removing unstable_noStore() Usage

**CRITICAL: unstable_noStore() is incompatible with Cache Components**

The `unstable_noStore()` API was used in the old caching model to opt-out of static rendering. With Cache Components, this API is no longer needed because:

1. **Everything is dynamic by default** - No need to opt-out of caching
2. **Use "use cache" to opt-in** - The paradigm is reversed
3. **unstable_noStore() causes errors** - Will break Cache Components behavior

**📖 For complete migration patterns and code examples, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to the **"unstable_noStore Examples"** section for:
- Basic removal (keep dynamic)
- Migration with Suspense boundary
- Migration to cached content
- Complete before/after examples
- Hybrid approach patterns

**Quick Migration Steps:**

1. **Search for usage:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "unstable_noStore" app/ src/
   ```

2. **Remove the import and calls:**
   ```typescript
   // Remove: import { unstable_noStore } from 'next/cache';
   // Remove: unstable_noStore();
   ```

3. **Add migration comment:**
   ```typescript
   // MIGRATED: Removed unstable_noStore() - dynamic by default with Cache Components
   ```

4. **Choose migration path:**
   - **Keep dynamic (most common):** No changes needed - already dynamic by default
   - **Add Suspense:** Wrap in `<Suspense>` for better UX with loading states
   - **Cache instead:** Add `"use cache"` if content should actually be cached

5. **Load the resource for detailed examples** specific to your use case

### Importing and Commenting cacheLife() and cacheTag() - Let Users Decide

**IMPORTANT: Always Include Imports with Decision Comments**

When adding `"use cache"` to any component or function, follow this template pattern:

```typescript
// ⚠️ CACHING STRATEGY DECISION NEEDED:
// This component uses "use cache" - decide on revalidation strategy
// 
// Uncomment ONLY ONE of the following strategies based on your needs:

// Option A: Time-based revalidation (most common)
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';
// cacheLife('hours');  // Revalidates every hour, expires after 1 day

// Option B: On-demand tag-based revalidation
// import { cacheTag } from 'next/cache';
// cacheTag('resource-name');  // Tag for manual revalidation via updateTag/revalidateTag

// Option C: Long-term caching (use sparingly)
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';
// cacheLife('max');  // Revalidates every 30 days, cached for 1 year

// Option D: Short-lived cache (frequently updated content)
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';
// cacheLife('minutes');  // Revalidates every minute, expires after 1 hour

// Option E: Custom inline profile (advanced)
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';
// cacheLife({ 
//   stale: 300,      // Client caches for 5 minutes
//   revalidate: 3600,  // Revalidates every hour
//   expire: 86400      // Expires after 24 hours
// });

export default async function Page() {
  "use cache";
  // User should uncomment and configure ONE of the cacheLife/cacheTag options above
  
  const data = await fetch('...');
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

1. **User-Driven Decisions:** Each team's caching needs are different. Don't guess - let the developer decide
2. **Explicit Documentation:** The comments make the decision point obvious and unavoidable
3. **Clear Options:** All valid strategies are present and documented
4. **Easy to Update:** When requirements change, users can quickly update the caching strategy
5. **No Silent Defaults:** If developer forgets to configure, they'll see the commented imports as a reminder

**Detailed Guidance for Each Strategy:**

**Strategy A: Time-Based Revalidation (Recommended for most cases)**
```typescript
// DECISION: Blog posts change daily, cached for speed
// Using 'hours' profile: revalidates every hour, expires after 1 day
// Uncomment the import below AND the cacheLife call in the function:
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';

export default async function BlogPost() {
  "use cache";
  
  // Uncomment the line below to enable time-based revalidation:
  // cacheLife('hours');
  
  const post = await fetchFromCMS();
  return <article>{post}</article>;
}
```
**When to use:**
- Content that changes on a predictable schedule
- User-facing pages that can show slightly stale data
- High-traffic routes that need caching performance

**Strategy B: Tag-Based Revalidation (For event-triggered updates)**
```typescript
// DECISION: Product details cached, but revalidate on inventory changes
// Use cacheTag to manually trigger revalidation when product updates
// Uncomment the import below AND the cacheTag call in the function:
// import { cacheTag } from 'next/cache';

export default async function ProductPage() {
  "use cache";
  
  // Uncomment the line below to enable tag-based revalidation:
  // cacheTag('products', `product-${id}`);
  
  const product = await fetchProduct(id);
  return <ProductDisplay product={product} />;
}
```
**When to use:**
- Content that updates unpredictably (admin actions)
- E-commerce products with inventory changes
- Content managed in CMS with manual publish events
- Multiple related resources that revalidate together

**Strategy C: Long-Term Caching (Use Sparingly)**
```typescript
// ⚠️ DECISION: Content rarely changes (e.g., archived pages, historical data)
// Using 'max' profile: revalidates every 30 days, cached for 1 year
// Uncomment the import below AND the cacheLife call in the function:
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';

export default async function StaticContent() {
  "use cache";
  
  // Uncomment the line below for long-term caching:
  // cacheLife('max');
  
  const content = await fetchArchive();
  return <Archive content={content} />;
}
```
**When to use:**
- Truly immutable content (historical data, archived pages)
- Reference content that never changes
- Static files rendered as components

**Strategy D: Short-Lived Cache (For frequently updating content)**
```typescript
// DECISION: Metrics update frequently, need low revalidation time
// Using 'minutes' profile: revalidates every minute, expires after 1 hour
// Uncomment the import below AND the cacheLife call in the function:
// import { cacheLife } from 'next/cache';

export default async function RealtimeMetrics() {
  "use cache";
  
  // Uncomment the line below to enable short-lived caching:
  // cacheLife('minutes');
  
  const metrics = await fetchMetrics();
  return <Dashboard metrics={metrics} />;
}
```
**When to use:**
- Dashboards and real-time data
- Leaderboards and rankings
- Stock prices and live data
- Activity feeds

**When to Use Multiple Tags:**
```typescript
// DECISION: Cache user-specific dashboard with multiple revalidation triggers
// Revalidate on: user profile changes, new comments, new notifications
// Uncomment the import below AND the cacheTag calls in the function:
// import { cacheTag } from 'next/cache';

export default async function UserDashboard({ userId }: Props) {
  "use cache";
  
  // Uncomment the lines below to enable multi-tag revalidation:
  // cacheTag('user-dashboard', `user-${userId}`);
  // cacheTag('user-profile', `user-${userId}`);
  // cacheTag('user-comments', `user-${userId}`);
  // cacheTag('user-notifications', `user-${userId}`);
  
  const dashboard = await buildDashboard(userId);
  return <Dashboard data={dashboard} />;
}
```

**Migration Checklist - cacheLife/cacheTag:**

For EVERY component/function with `"use cache"`:

- [ ] **Review imports:** Are `cacheLife` and/or `cacheTag` imports commented but visible?
- [ ] **User decision:** Has someone decided which revalidation strategy to use?
- [ ] **Configuration:** Is the chosen strategy uncommented and configured?
- [ ] **Documentation:** Does the code comment explain WHY this strategy was chosen?
- [ ] **Testing:** Have you verified the cache behavior matches expectations?

**Red Flags - cacheLife/cacheTag Issues:**

- ❌ **`"use cache"` without any cacheLife/cacheTag:** Will cache forever by default - decide intentionally
- ❌ **cacheLife configured but no comment:** Future developers won't know why this value was chosen
- ❌ **Multiple conflicting cacheTag calls:** May cause unexpected revalidation behavior
- ❌ **cacheTag on non-revalidatable routes:** Tag-based revalidation won't work on static routes
- ❌ **Very short revalidation times:** (< 30 seconds) - Consider if caching helps performance at all

### Special Case: Handling `new Date()` and `Math.random()` in Cache Components

When migrating to Cache Components, you'll frequently encounter `new Date()` and `Math.random()` usage. These require explicit handling because:

- **Problem:** These return different values on every call
- **In Static Rendering:** They're captured at build time and stay the same across all requests
- **In Cache Components:** They create ambiguity - should the value be frozen at cache time or fresh per-request?

**Decision Framework for `new Date()` / `Math.random()`:**

When you encounter these patterns, ask: **"Should this value be captured at cache time, or fresh per-request?"**

**Option 1: Fresh Per-Request (Recommended for most cases)**
```typescript
// ⚠️ Requires making component dynamic
// Use this for: timestamps, random IDs, request-specific values

export default async function Page() {
  "use cache: private"; // Always fresh, never cached
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString(); // Fresh on every render
  return <div>Generated at: {timestamp}</div>;
}
```

**Option 2: Captured at Cache Time (With Awareness)**
```typescript
// ✅ Value is frozen when component is cached
// Use this for: "createdAt" timestamps, random seed values that should be stable
// MUST document the tradeoff

export default async function Page() {
  "use cache";
  cacheLife('days'); // Revalidates daily, timestamp refreshes once per day
  
  // ⚠️ CACHE DECISION: This timestamp is frozen at cache time
  // It will stay the same for all users for 24 hours
  // After cacheLife revalidation, a new timestamp is generated
  const generatedAt = new Date().toISOString();
  
  return <div>Generated at: {generatedAt}</div>;
}
```

**Option 3: Extract to Separate Dynamic Component**
```typescript
// ✅ Best for mixed static + dynamic content
// Cache the static part, render dynamic part separately

export default async function Page() {
  "use cache"; // Page content cached
  cacheLife('days'); // Revalidates daily for static content
  
  const staticContent = <MainContent />; // Cached
  
  return (
    <div>
      {staticContent}
      <Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
        <DynamicTimestamp /> {/* Fresh per-request */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

async function DynamicTimestamp() {
  "use cache: private"; // Always fresh
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  return <p>Rendered at: {timestamp}</p>;
}
```

**Migration Checklist for Date/Random Values:**

When you encounter `new Date()` or `Math.random()`:

1. **Identify the usage:**
   - Is it used in a cached component?
   - Is it used in multiple components?
   - What is the intended behavior?

2. **Add a comment explaining your decision:**
   ```typescript
   // DECISION: Timestamp should be fresh for user authentication
   // Strategy: Using "use cache: private" for always-fresh rendering
   const userId = Math.random(); // Fresh random ID per request
   ```

3. **Choose your approach:**
   - [ ] Keep in `"use cache: private"` - Always fresh (recommended)
   - [ ] Keep in `"use cache"` - Frozen at cache time (document why)
   - [ ] Extract to separate dynamic component - Mixed strategy

4. **Document the behavior:**
   ```typescript
   // ⚠️ CACHE TRADEOFF: This random value is generated once per cache revalidation
   // All users see the same value until cache expires (revalidate: 3600)
   const sessionId = Math.random();
   ```

5. **Test the behavior:**
   - In dev mode: Check that values refresh/stay same as expected
   - In build mode: Verify prerendered pages show consistent values
   - After revalidation: Confirm new values are generated

**Common Patterns:**

| Pattern | Behavior | Fix |
|---------|----------|-----|
| `new Date()` in cached component (timestamp) | Frozen at cache time | Add comment explaining tradeoff, or extract to `"use cache: private"` |
| `Math.random()` for IDs | Same ID for all users/requests until cache revalidates | Use `"use cache: private"` if ID should be unique per user/request |
| `new Date()` in SSR server function | Captured at build time, frozen forever | Use `await connection()` to mark as dynamic, or move to `"use cache: private"` |
| `Math.random()` in static page | Same number on every visit | Intentional or bug? Add comment explaining |

**Red Flags - These Require Explicit Handling:**

- ❌ **Using current time for cache keys:** Use `cacheTag()` for invalidation instead of relying on timestamps
- ❌ **Expecting different random values per user:** Use `"use cache: private"` to ensure per-request freshness
- ❌ **Seed-based random without documentation:** Add comments explaining why the seed matters
- ❌ **Comparing timestamps across cache boundaries:** Document the expected behavior explicitly

**After Each Fix:**

1. **Review Your Decision:**
   - Did you add a comment explaining why you chose cache vs dynamic?
   - Did you add `cacheLife()` with appropriate times based on content change frequency?
   - Did you add `cacheTag()` if there's a clear revalidation trigger?
   - For dynamic content, did you explain why it needs to be per-request?

2. **Save the file**
   - Fast Refresh will automatically apply changes
   - Dev server continues running (no restart needed)

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Re-load the route in browser: `browser_eval({ action: "navigate", url: "<base-url><route-path>" })`
   - Connect to MCP Endpoint: `<base-url>/_next/mcp` (using endpoint from Phase 3)
   - Call `get_errors` again via MCP to verify fix (collects from browser session)
   - Verify error is resolved

4. **Validate the decision:**
   - Does the cached content render correctly?
   - If dynamic, does Suspense show appropriate loading state?
   - Does the route respond quickly?

5. **Move to next error**

**Quality Checklist for Each Fix:**
- ✅ Comment added explaining cache/dynamic decision
- ✅ `cacheLife()` configured based on content change frequency (if cached)
- ✅ `cacheTag()` added if content has clear update triggers (if cached)
- ✅ Route loads without errors
- ✅ Content displays correctly
- ✅ Performance is acceptable

**Handling Unclear Cases That Can't Be Resolved:**

If after multiple attempts a fix continues to fail or the issue is unclear, leave a comment documenting the problem:

```typescript
// ⚠️ UNRESOLVED: Unable to determine caching strategy for this component
// Issue: Third-party component [ComponentName] from [package] - internal implementation unclear
// Error: [specific error that persists]
// Recommendation: Review third-party documentation or consider alternative approach
// TODO: Revisit this when [condition - e.g., package updates, documentation available]
```

**Common Unclear Cases:**
- Third-party components with unknown/complex internal state management
- Components using undocumented async patterns
- External library integrations with unclear rendering behavior
- Timing-dependent code that behaves differently in cache vs runtime

**When to Leave This Comment:**
1. You've tried multiple caching strategies (cache, Suspense, private cache)
2. All attempts result in the same error or unexpected behavior
3. The root cause is unclear (third-party code, complex state, etc.)
4. You've verified the error isn't due to missing Suspense/cache directives
5. The component works but you can't determine the appropriate caching mode

**Example Scenarios:**
```typescript
// ⚠️ UNRESOLVED: Cannot determine caching strategy for PaymentGateway
// Issue: Third-party payment component uses internal async provider pattern
// Error: Blocks route regardless of Suspense boundary placement
// Recommendation: Check payment provider's Cache Components compatibility docs
// TODO: Revisit after upgrading to payment SDK v3.0+

// ⚠️ UNRESOLVED: Analytics dashboard component timing issue
// Issue: Component works in dev but different behavior in build prerender
// Error: Cached value inconsistent between prerender and runtime
// Recommendation: Investigate hydration mismatch, may need "use cache: private"
// TODO: Profile in production build to understand timing behavior
```

This allows the codebase to be functional while clearly marking areas needing future investigation.

**Continue until:**
- All routes return 200 OK
- `get_errors` returns no errors
- No console warnings related to Cache Components
- All fixes have explanatory comments

**Verification Strategy After All Fixes:**

Once all errors are fixed, choose the verification approach based on total route count:

**If total routes < 8 (Small Project):**
- ✅ Use `<pkg-manager> run build` to verify all fixes
- Build verification is comprehensive and efficient for small projects
- Provides detailed error output if any issues remain
- Skips dev server verification (faster, no Fast Refresh needed)

**If total routes >= 8 (Larger Project):**
- ✅ Use dev server with `next dev` and Fast Refresh for interactive verification
- Faster feedback during fixing iterations
- Better for testing dynamic content behavior
- Can verify routes progressively without full build

**Important:**
- The dev server should REMAIN RUNNING throughout all fixes (if using dev verification)
- Fast Refresh automatically applies your changes
- Do NOT restart the server unless it crashes
- Every fix should include comments explaining the decision

## PHASE 6: Final Verification
────────────────────────────────────────

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All fixes applied in Phase 5
- ✅ Dev server is still running
- ✅ All routes verified with get_errors

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Load verification resource**

You MUST load:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior")
```

This provides build verification strategies and troubleshooting guidance.

Run comprehensive checks:

1. **All Routes Final Test**
   With dev server still running:
   - Request all routes one final time
   - Verify all return successfully (200 OK)
   - Call get_errors one last time via MCP
   - Expected: Empty error list

2. **Stop Dev Server**
   Now that development verification is complete:
   ```bash
   # Stop the background dev server process
   # (You can now safely stop it)
   ```

3. **Build Test with Debug Prerender**
   ```bash
   # First, attempt with debug-prerender flag if available
   <pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
   ```

   If `--debug-prerender` is not supported:
   ```bash
   # Fallback to standard build
   <pkg-manager> run build
   ```

   Expected:
   - Build succeeds without errors
   - Build output shows cache status for each route
   - With `--debug-prerender`: Detailed prerender diagnostics and cache analysis
   - Check for any build-time errors that didn't appear in dev
   - All routes prerendered or marked as dynamic correctly

4. **Dev Mode Test**
   ```bash
   __NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> next dev
   # Test a few key routes in dev mode
   ```
   Expected:
   - Server starts successfully
   - Key routes work correctly
   - Cached content behavior can be observed

## Important Caching Behavior Notes
────────────────────────────────────────

### Memory Cache vs Persistent Cache

**Self-Hosting (Long-Running Server):**
- `"use cache"` entries saved in memory
- Available for subsequent requests within same process
- Lost when server restarts

**Vercel / Serverless:**
- NO memory cache between requests (lambda is ephemeral)
- `"use cache"` only effective if included in prerendered fallback shell
- If cached content is in same Suspense boundary as blocking content, it won't be in shell
- For persistent cache between requests, use `"use cache: remote"` to store in Vercel Data Cache (VDC)

**Key Implication:**
If you see a cached component re-executing on every request:
1. Check if there's blocking async IO in the same Suspense boundary
2. Either: Wrap blocking content in its own Suspense boundary
3. Or: Use `"use cache: remote"` for VDC storage

### Prefetching Behavior

**Production Only:**
- Link prefetching ONLY works in production (`npm run build && npm start`)
- In development, prefetching is disabled
- Test prefetching in production build before deploying

**What Gets Prefetched:**
- Static shells for routes with `<Link>` components in viewport
- Only NEW static content (not already in cache)
- Full cached components (with `"use cache"`)
- `"use cache: private"` content can be prefetched with runtime values (cookies, params, searchParams)

### Static Shell Storage

**Build Output:**
- Saved in `.next` directory during build
- Served as static assets (self-hosting)
- Stored in ISR cache on Vercel (globally distributed to edge)

**Partial Revalidation:**
- Can be revalidated without full rebuilds
- Using `revalidateTag` or `revalidatePath`
- Based on `cacheLife` revalidate/expire times

## Migration Notes
[Any special notes about the migration, especially if migrating from PPR]

## Complete Changes Summary
This enablement process made the following comprehensive changes:

### Configuration Changes (Phase 2):
- ✅ Enabled cacheComponents (location depends on version)
- ✅ Removed incompatible flags (ppr, dynamicIO)
- ✅ Preserved compatible flags
- ✅ Documented Route Segment Config

### Boundary & Cache Setup (Phase 5):
- ✅ Added Suspense boundaries for dynamic content
- ✅ Added "use cache" directives for cacheable content
- ✅ Added "use cache: private" for prefetchable private content
- ✅ Created loading.tsx files where appropriate
- ✅ Added generateStaticParams for dynamic routes

### API Migrations (Phase 5):
- ✅ Moved cookies()/headers() calls outside cache scope
- ✅ Handled dynamic values (connection(), "use cache" with cacheLife, or Suspense as appropriate)
- ✅ Migrated Route Segment Config to "use cache" + cacheLife
- ✅ Removed all export const dynamic/revalidate/fetchCache

### Cache Optimization (Phase 5):
- ✅ Added cacheTag() calls for granular revalidation
- ✅ Configured cacheLife profiles for revalidation control
- ✅ Set up cache invalidation strategies

## Next Steps
- Monitor application behavior in development
- Test interactive features with Cache Components
- Review cacheLife profile usage for optimization
- Test prefetching in production build
- Consider enabling Turbopack file system caching for faster dev
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust cacheLife profiles

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If cached components re-execute on every request: Check Suspense boundaries, consider "use cache: remote"
- If prefetching doesn't work: Test in production build, not dev mode
- If routes still show blocking errors: Look for parent Suspense or add "use cache"
- If "use cache" with params fails: Add generateStaticParams
- If dynamic APIs fail in cache: Move outside cache scope or use "use cache: private"
- If Route Segment Config errors: Remove exports, use "use cache" + cacheLife instead

## What Was Accomplished
Cache Components is now fully enabled with:
- ✅ Configuration flags properly set
- ✅ All routes verified and working
- ✅ All boundaries properly configured
- ✅ All cache directives in place
- ✅ All API migrations completed
- ✅ Cache optimization strategies implemented
- ✅ Zero errors in final verification
- ✅ Production build tested and passing
```

# START HERE
Begin Cache Components enablement:
1. Start with Phase 1 pre-flight checks
2. Enable Cache Components in config (Phase 2)
3. Start dev server with MCP (Phase 3) - **START ONLY ONCE, DO NOT RESTART** (optional - may not be needed for Phase 5)
4. Verify routes and collect errors (Phase 4) - **OPTIONAL, can skip and go directly to Phase 5**
5. Fix all errors using build-first approach (Phase 5):
   - Run `<pkg-manager> run build` to see all errors
   - Fix based on explicit error messages
   - Verify in dev with Fast Refresh if needed
6. Run final verification (Phase 6)

**Critical Rules:**
- **NEVER restart the dev server** - Start it once in Phase 3, let it run through Phase 4 and 5
- Use the get_errors MCP tool frequently to catch and fix issues early
- If you see lock file or port errors, the server is already running - DO NOT start again
- The goal is zero errors and all routes working with Cache Components enabled
