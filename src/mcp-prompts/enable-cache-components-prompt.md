# BASE KNOWLEDGE: Cache Components Technical Reference

**✅ RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON-DEMAND - Load only what you need**

**Available Resources (Load as Needed):**

The following resources are available from the Next.js MCP server. Load them on-demand to reduce token usage:

- `nextjs16://knowledge/overview` - Critical errors AI agents make, quick reference (START HERE)
- `nextjs16://knowledge/core-mechanics` - Fundamental paradigm shift, cacheComponents
- `nextjs16://knowledge/public-caches` - Public cache mechanics using 'use cache'
- `nextjs16://knowledge/private-caches` - Private cache mechanics using 'use cache: private'
- `nextjs16://knowledge/runtime-prefetching` - Prefetch configuration and stale time rules
- `nextjs16://knowledge/request-apis` - Async params, searchParams, cookies(), headers()
- `nextjs16://knowledge/cache-invalidation` - updateTag(), revalidateTag() patterns
- `nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns` - cacheLife(), cacheTag(), draft mode
- `nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior` - What gets prerendered, static shells
- `nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns` - Common errors and solutions
- `nextjs16://knowledge/test-patterns` - Real test-driven patterns from 125+ fixtures
- `nextjs16://knowledge/reference` - Mental models, API reference, checklists

**How to Access Resources (MANDATORY - ALWAYS LOAD):**

Resources use the URI scheme `nextjs16://knowledge/...` and are served by this MCP server.

**CRITICAL: You MUST load resources at each phase phase - this is not optional.**

To load a resource, use the ReadMcpResourceTool with:
- server: `"next-devtools"` (or whatever your server is configured as)
- uri: `"nextjs16://knowledge/[resource-name]"` from the list above

**MANDATORY Resource Loading Schedule:**

You MUST load these resources at the specified phases:

- **BEFORE Phase 1-2:** ALWAYS load `nextjs16://knowledge/overview` first
  - Provides critical context and error patterns AI agents make
  - Must be loaded before any configuration changes

- **During Phase 5 (Error Fixing):** ALWAYS load error-specific resources as needed
  - When fixing blocking route errors → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns`
  - When configuring caching → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns`
  - When using dynamic params → Load `nextjs16://knowledge/core-mechanics`
  - Do NOT guess or use generic patterns - load the specific resource

- **During Phase 6 (Verification):** ALWAYS load `nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior`
  - Provides build verification strategies and troubleshooting

**Why This Matters:**

- Resources contain proven solutions from 125+ test fixtures
- Generic patterns may not work with Cache Components specifics
- Loading ensures you follow exact API semantics and error patterns
- Token savings only work if resources are loaded when needed
- Without loading, you may apply incorrect fixes

**Token Efficiency:**

This mandatory loading strategy keeps tokens low while being complete:
- ✅ Loads ~5-15K tokens per phase (not 60K upfront)
- ✅ Each resource addresses specific problem sets
- ✅ No guessing or hallucination about patterns
- ✅ Supports multiple phases in one session
- ✅ Stays within conversation budget

# ENABLE WORKFLOW: Complete Cache Components Setup & Verification Guide

The section below contains the comprehensive step-by-step enablement workflow. This guide includes ALL steps needed to enable Cache Components: configuration updates, flag changes, boundary setup, error detection, and automated fixing. Load the knowledge base resources above for detailed technical behavior, API semantics, and best practices.

## What Are Cache Components?

Cache Components are a new set of features designed to make caching in Next.js both **more explicit and more flexible**. They fundamentally change how Next.js handles rendering:

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- **Before (implicit caching):** Routes were static by default, you opted into dynamic rendering
- **After (Cache Components):** Routes are dynamic by default, you opt into caching with `"use cache"`
- **Goal:** Better align with developer expectations while preserving static pre-rendering capabilities

**What Cache Components Achieve:**

1. **Explicit Opt-In Caching:**
   - All dynamic code executes at request time by default
   - Use `"use cache"` directive to cache pages, components, or functions
   - Compiler automatically generates cache keys

2. **Complete PPR (Partial Prerendering) Story:**
   - Instead of using Suspense to opt-in to dynamic (old PPR)
   - Now use `"use cache"` to opt-in to static (new paradigm)
   - Mix cached and dynamic content in the same route

3. **Flexible Caching Levels:**
   - `"use cache"` - Public cache for build-time prerendering
   - `"use cache: private"` - Private cache for runtime prefetching (can access cookies/params)
   - `"use cache: remote"` - Persistent cache for serverless environments

4. **Runtime Prefetching:**
   - Prefetch routes with actual runtime values (cookies, params, searchParams)
   - Instant client navigations without loading states
   - Cache snapshots of components in static shells

**The Core Concept: Push Down Dynamic Boundaries**

The key strategy with Cache Components is to **push dynamic boundaries as far down the component tree as possible**, making as much of your UI static as you can:

```
Static Shell (instant load)
├─ Cached Header ("use cache")
├─ Cached Sidebar ("use cache")
└─ <Suspense>
   └─ Dynamic Content (per-request)
```

This gives you:
- ✅ Fast initial page load (static shell)
- ✅ Reduced server load (cached components)
- ✅ Fresh data where needed (dynamic content)

## Overview: What This Process Covers

This prompt automates the complete Cache Components enablement workflow:

**Configuration & Flags (Phase 1-2):**
- ✅ Detect package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun)
- ✅ Verify Next.js version (16.0.0 stable or canary only - beta NOT supported)
- ✅ Enable cacheComponents (experimental in 16.0.0, stable in canary)
- ✅ Migrate from `experimental.dynamicIO` or `experimental.ppr` if needed
- ✅ Document existing Route Segment Config for migration

**Dev Server & MCP Setup (Phase 3):**
- ✅ Start dev server once with MCP enabled (`__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true`)
- ✅ Verify MCP server is active and responding
- ✅ Capture base URL and MCP endpoint for error detection

**Error Detection (Phase 4 - Optional):**
- ✅ Start browser and load every route using browser_eval tool
- ✅ Collect errors from browser session using Next.js MCP `get_errors` tool
- ✅ Categorize all Cache Components errors by type
- ✅ Build comprehensive error list before fixing
- ℹ️  Phase 4 can be skipped if proceeding directly to Phase 5 build-first approach

**Automated Fixing (Phase 5 - Build-First Strategy):**
- ✅ Run `<pkg-manager> run build` to identify all failing routes at once
- ✅ Get explicit error messages for every issue in build output
- ✅ Fix errors directly based on clear error messages from build
- ✅ Or verify in dev server with `next dev` for interactive fixing with Fast Refresh
- ✅ Fix blocking route errors (add Suspense boundaries or "use cache")
- ✅ Fix dynamic value errors (add `await connection()`)
- ✅ Fix route params errors (add `generateStaticParams`)
- ✅ Fix unavailable API errors (move outside cache or use "use cache: private")
- ✅ Migrate Route Segment Config to "use cache" + cacheLife
- ✅ Add cache tags with cacheTag() for on-demand revalidation
- ✅ Configure cacheLife profiles for revalidation control
- ✅ Verify each fix with Fast Refresh (no restart needed)

**Final Verification (Phase 6):**
- ✅ Verify all routes return 200 OK
- ✅ Confirm zero errors with final `get_errors` check
- ✅ Stop dev server after verification
- ✅ Run production build and test

**Key Features:**
- One-time dev server start (no restarts needed)
- Automated error detection using Next.js MCP tools
- Browser-based testing with browser automation
- Fast Refresh applies fixes instantly
- Comprehensive fix strategies for all error types

## Decision Guide: Static vs Dynamic - A Question-Driven Approach

**📖 For complete decision-making guidance with detailed examples, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to **"Cache Components Examples"** → **"Decision Guide: Static vs Dynamic"** for:
- Complete 4-question framework
- Decision approaches with full code examples (A, B, C, D)
- Decision summary table
- When to ask human for ambiguous cases

**Quick Reference - 4 Key Questions:**

1. **Is this content the same for all users?**
   - YES → `"use cache"` | NO → Suspense or `"use cache: private"`

2. **How often does this content change?**
   - Rarely (days/weeks) → `"use cache"` + long `cacheLife`
   - Occasionally (hours) → `"use cache"` + medium `cacheLife`
   - Frequently (minutes) → `"use cache"` + short `cacheLife`
   - Constantly (per-request) → `<Suspense>`

3. **Does this content use user-specific data?**
   - YES, from cookies/session → Suspense OR `"use cache: private"`
   - YES, from route params → `"use cache"` + `generateStaticParams`
   - NO → `"use cache"`

4. **Can this content be revalidated on-demand?**
   - YES (CMS updates, admin actions) → `"use cache"` + `cacheTag()`
   - NO (no clear trigger) → time-based `cacheLife` or Suspense

**Load the MCP resource for complete decision approaches and code examples.**

## PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Checks
────────────────────────────────────────

**⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Load the overview resource**

BEFORE doing anything, you MUST load:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/overview")
```

This provides critical context about Cache Components and common mistakes.

Before enabling Cache Components:

1. **Detect Package Manager**
   Check: package.json "packageManager" field or lock files

   **Template Variables:**
   ```
   npm:   <pkg-manager> = npm        <pkg-exec> = npx
   pnpm:  <pkg-manager> = pnpm       <pkg-exec> = pnpx
   yarn:  <pkg-manager> = yarn       <pkg-exec> = yarn dlx
   bun:   <pkg-manager> = bun        <pkg-exec> = bunx
   ```

2. **Next.js Version Check**
   Required: 16.0.0 stable or 16.x-canary.x (beta NOT supported)
   Check: package.json → dependencies.next
   Action: If < 16.0.0, run upgrade-nextjs-16 prompt first

3. **Existing Configuration Check**
   **Find the config file first:**
   Check for these files in order (use the first one found):
   - `next.config.ts`
   - `next.config.mjs`
   - `next.config.js`
   - `next.config.cjs`
   
   If no config file exists, you'll create `next.config.js` in Phase 2.
   
   **Read the config file and look for:**
   - `cacheComponents` or `experimental.cacheComponents` (current)
   - `experimental.dynamicIO` (old name - migrate to cacheComponents)
   - `experimental.ppr` (removed - migrate to cacheComponents)

4. **Route Structure Analysis**
   Scan: app directory structure
   Identify: All routes (page.tsx/page.js files)
   Note: List all routes for Phase 3 verification

5. **Existing Route Segment Config Check**
   Search for all Route Segment Config exports using:
   - Pattern: `"export const (dynamic|revalidate|fetchCache|runtime|preferredRegion|dynamicParams)"`
   - Path: `"app"`
   
   ⚠️  WARNING: Route Segment Config options are DISABLED with Cache Components
   Action: Document all locations - will migrate to `"use cache"` + `cacheLife` in Phase 5

6. **unstable_noStore Usage Check**
   Search for all `unstable_noStore()` calls:
   - Pattern: `"unstable_noStore"`
   - Path: `"app"`
   
   ⚠️  WARNING: `unstable_noStore()` is INCOMPATIBLE with Cache Components
   
   **Why:** With Cache Components, everything is dynamic by default. `unstable_noStore()` was used to opt-out of static rendering in the old model, but this is now the default behavior.
   
   **📖 For detailed migration examples, load:**
   ```
   Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples" (see unstable_noStore Examples section)
   ```
   
   Action: Document all locations - will remove in Phase 5

## PHASE 2: Enable Cache Components Configuration
────────────────────────────────────────
Update the Next.js configuration to enable Cache Components. This phase handles ALL configuration and flag changes needed.

**Step 1: Identify config file format**
From Phase 1, you should know which config file exists:
- `next.config.ts` (TypeScript)
- `next.config.mjs` (ESM)
- `next.config.js` (CommonJS)
- `next.config.cjs` (CommonJS explicit)
- Or no config file (will create `next.config.js`)

Use the same format/extension when making changes.

**Step 2: Backup existing config**
If config file exists, copy it before making changes.
If no config exists, you'll create a new one in the next step.

**Step 3: Update cacheComponents flag**

Enable the `cacheComponents` flag in your Next.js config. The flag location differs by version:

**Version-Aware Configuration:**

Check your Next.js version: `grep '"next":' package.json`

- **16.0.0 stable**: `experimental.cacheComponents = true`
- **Canary (16.x-canary.x)**: `cacheComponents = true` (no longer experimental)

**Starting Fresh:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts (or .js)
// For 16.0.0: Put cacheComponents inside experimental: {}
// For canary: Put cacheComponents at root level
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,  // canary only
  experimental: {
    cacheComponents: true,  // 16.0.0 only - use ONE of these
  },
}
```

**Migrating from experimental.dynamicIO or experimental.ppr:**
```diff
  const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
-     dynamicIO: true,  // or ppr: true (both removed)
+     cacheComponents: true,  // 16.0.0 - for canary, move to root level
    },
  }
```

⚠️  **Note**: PPR and dynamicIO are replaced by cacheComponents with enhanced features (cacheLife, cacheTag, "use cache: private")

**Step 3: Remove incompatible flags**

If present, REMOVE these flags (they conflict with Cache Components):
```diff
  const nextConfig = {
    experimental: {
      cacheComponents: true,
-     ppr: true,              // Remove - replaced by cacheComponents
    },
  }
```

**Step 4: Preserve compatible flags**

These flags CAN coexist with cacheComponents:
- `turbo`, `serverActions`, `mdxRs` - All compatible

Example:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  cacheComponents: true,  // canary - or inside experimental: {} for 16.0.0
  experimental: {
    turbo: { rules: {} },
    serverActions: { bodySizeLimit: '2mb' },
  },
}
```

**Step 5: Document Route Segment Config usage**

Search for Route Segment Config exports (these are DISABLED with Cache Components):

**Search Pattern:**
- Use search with pattern: `"export const (dynamic|revalidate|fetchCache|runtime|preferredRegion|dynamicParams)"`
- In path: `"app"`
- This will find ALL Route Segment Config exports that need migration

⚠️  **CRITICAL: All Route Segment Config options are DISABLED with Cache Components**

**Migration Map:**
- `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` → Add `"use cache"` + cacheLife
- `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` → Add `<Suspense>` boundary
- `export const revalidate = 3600` → Use `cacheLife('hours')` or custom profile
- `export const fetchCache = 'force-cache'` → Add `"use cache"`
- `export const runtime = 'edge'` → Keep (still supported)
- `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` → Remove (this is the default, no need to specify)
- `export const dynamicParams = true` → Use `generateStaticParams` instead

**When removing exports, add migration comments:**
```typescript
// MIGRATED: Was 'force-static' (export const dynamic) - now using "use cache"
// MIGRATED: Was 'force-dynamic' (export const dynamic) - now using <Suspense>
// MIGRATED: Was revalidate: 3600 - now using cacheLife('hours')
```

Document all locations now - you'll migrate them in Phase 5.

**Step 6: Verify configuration changes**

Verify by reading the config file:
- ✅ cacheComponents enabled (location depends on version)
- ✅ Incompatible flags removed (ppr, dynamicIO)
- ✅ Compatible flags preserved
- ✅ Valid syntax, correct file format

**What's Next:**
With configuration updated, Phase 3 will start the dev server and Phase 4 will detect any runtime errors that need fixing.

## PHASE 3: Start Dev Server with MCP (Optional)
────────────────────────────────────────

**IMPORTANT: This phase is optional.** You can skip directly to Phase 5 (build-first approach) if you prefer to identify all errors upfront from the build output.

**If using Phase 3/Phase 4 workflow:** Only start the dev server ONCE. Do NOT restart it during this process.

### Step 1: Start Dev Server (ONE TIME ONLY)

```bash
# Start dev server in background with MCP enabled
__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> dev
```

**This command:**
- Runs in the background
- Should only be executed ONCE
- Will continue running throughout Phase 4 and Phase 5
- Should NOT be restarted unless it crashes

### Step 2: Wait for Server to Start

```bash
# Wait 10-15 seconds for server to initialize
sleep 10
```

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running

Wait for the server output to show:
- ✅ "Ready started server..." or "Local: ..."
- ✅ No fatal errors
- ✅ MCP server started message (if available)

The dev server will automatically use an available port and display the URL.

### Step 4: Verify MCP Server is Active

**Connect to Next.js MCP Server:**

The MCP server is available at `{dev-server-url}/_next/mcp`

Example: If dev server shows `http://localhost:3000`, connect to `http://localhost:3000/_next/mcp`

Try calling `get_project_metadata`:

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Successfully connects to MCP endpoint
- ✅ Returns project metadata (name, version, config, dependencies)
- ✅ Shows cacheComponents enabled (confirms Phase 2 succeeded)

**If the tool is not available or connection fails:**

First attempt troubleshooting (DO NOT restart the server):
1. Wait another 10 seconds - MCP server may still be initializing
2. Retry calling `get_project_metadata`
3. Check dev server output for:
   - "MCP server started" or similar message
   - Any MCP-related errors
4. Verify __NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true was set in the environment

If still failing after retry:
- Check if dev server is actually running (port should be occupied)
- Look for error messages in dev server output
- Verify the Next.js version supports MCP (16.0.0+)
- **LAST RESORT ONLY:** If dev server crashed, then you can restart it
- **DO NOT restart if server is running** - troubleshoot the MCP connection first

**Why this check matters:**
- Phase 4 relies heavily on the `get_errors` tool from Next.js MCP server
- Without MCP, you won't be able to detect Cache Components errors
- `get_project_metadata` is the simplest tool to verify MCP is alive
- Better to verify now than discover MCP is broken during route verification

### Step 5: Ready for Route Verification

**Phase 3 Complete:**
- ✅ Dev server running (will show URL in output)
- ✅ MCP server active and verified
- ✅ Ready to test routes in Phase 4

**Server State:**
- ⚠️ Do NOT stop or restart the server until Phase 6 is complete

## PHASE 4: Route Verification & Error Detection
────────────────────────────────────────

**CRITICAL: You MUST use browser_eval tool to load pages in browser**

Next.js MCP's `get_errors` tool collects errors from the browser session.
Without using the browser_eval tool to navigate pages, `get_errors` will have no
errors to collect.

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Dev server is running from Phase 3 (do NOT restart it)
- ✅ Dev server URL shown in terminal output (e.g., http://localhost:3000)
- ✅ MCP server is verified active (get_project_metadata responded)
- ✅ List of all routes from Phase 1
- ✅ browser_eval tool is available

**One-Time Setup (Before testing routes):**
1. Start browser automation:
   ```
   browser_eval({ action: "start", browser: "chrome", headless: true })
   ```

**Workflow per route:**
1. Use browser_eval tool with action "navigate" to load the page in browser
2. Use Next.js MCP get_errors to collect errors from that browser session
3. Categorize and record errors
4. Move to next route

Systematically verify each route and collect errors:

**For Each Route:**

1. **Navigate to Page in Browser (REQUIRED)**
   Use browser_eval with action "navigate" to load the page.
   
   Example: `browser_eval({ action: "navigate", url: "http://localhost:3000/dashboard" })`

   This loads the page in the browser and triggers any rendering errors.

2. **Collect Errors from Browser Session (using Next.js MCP)**
   Connect to Next.js MCP endpoint (at `{dev-server-url}/_next/mcp`) and call `get_errors`.
   
   Example: Connect to `http://localhost:3000/_next/mcp` and call `get_errors`

   The `get_errors` tool reads errors from the browser session you just created in step 1.

   Record:
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Affected route/component
   - Error type (build, runtime, render, etc.)

3. **Categorize Errors**
   Common Cache Components errors:

   a) **Blocking Route Error (Most Common)**
      Error message: "Route \"/path\": A component accessed data, headers, params, searchParams, or a short-lived cache without a Suspense boundary nor a \\\"use cache\\\" above it."

      Cause: Async IO outside Suspense boundary or "use cache"
      Async IO includes:
      - `await fetch()` - network requests
      - `await db.query()` - database calls
      - `await params` - route params
      - `await searchParams` - query params
      - `await cookies()` - request cookies
      - `await headers()` - request headers
      - `await somePromise` - any long-running promise

      Fix Options:
      1. Add parent Suspense boundary (preferred for truly dynamic content)
      2. Add `"use cache"` directive to component (for cacheable content)
      3. Use `loading.tsx` file convention (simplest for page-level)

   b) **Dynamic Value in Static Shell Error**
      Error message: "Dynamic value detected during prerender"

      Cause: Using sync dynamic APIs without marking as dynamic:
      - `Math.random()`
      - `new Date()`
      - Other time/randomness APIs

      Fix Options:
      1. Add `await connection()` before the dynamic API usage
      2. Add `"use cache"` to prerender these values

   c) **Route Params Without generateStaticParams**
      Error: Blocking route error when using `"use cache"` with dynamic params

      Cause: Using `await params` inside `"use cache"` without static params list

      Fix: Add `generateStaticParams` to provide known params at build time

   d) **Unavailable APIs in "use cache"**
      Error: "Cannot use [API] inside a cached function"

      APIs not available in `"use cache"`:
      - `cookies()` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)
      - `headers()` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)
      - `searchParams` (use `"use cache: private"` for prefetch-time access)

      Fix: Either remove from cache scope or use `"use cache: private"`

   e) **Route Segment Config Conflicts**
      Error: "Route Segment Config is not supported with Cache Components"

      Cause: Using `export const dynamic`, `export const revalidate`, etc.

      Fix: Remove Route Segment Config, use `"use cache"` + `cacheLife` instead

4. **Error Collection Format**
   For each error found, record:
   ```
   Route: [route-path]
   Error Type: [category from step 3]
   Message: [full error message]
   Stack: [stack trace if available]
   File: [affected file path]
   Line: [line number if available]
   ```

**Automation Strategy:**
- Start browser automation once at the beginning of Phase 4
- Use the dev server URL from terminal output for navigation
- Iterate through ALL routes from Phase 1
- For each route:
  1. Navigate with browser_eval({ action: "navigate", url: "..." })
  2. Connect to Next.js MCP endpoint (at `{dev-server-url}/_next/mcp`)
  3. Call get_errors to collect from browser session
  4. Record errors
  5. Move to next route
- Build comprehensive error list before fixing
- Prioritize errors by severity (build failures > runtime errors > warnings)

**Important:**
- Start browser automation once with browser_eval({ action: "start" }) before testing routes
- ALWAYS use browser_eval with action "navigate" before calling get_errors
- Always connect to the SAME Next.js MCP endpoint
- Do NOT try to reconnect or restart the MCP server
- If browser_eval navigation fails, ensure browser automation is started
- If Next.js MCP connection fails, the dev server may have crashed (rare)
- At the end of Phase 4, optionally close the browser with browser_eval({ action: "close" })

## PHASE 5: Automated Error Fixing & Boundary Setup
────────────────────────────────────────

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Configuration enabled in Phase 2
- ✅ Fast Refresh will apply changes automatically (no restart needed for fixes)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Load error-specific resources BEFORE making any changes**

You MUST load these resources to understand errors and fix them correctly:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/error-patterns")
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/advanced-patterns")
```

Do NOT guess or apply generic patterns. Use the exact code examples and strategies from these resources.

**OPTIMIZED STRATEGY: Fix Obvious Breaking Changes First, Then Build**

This phase uses a three-step workflow to minimize iteration cycles:

### Step 1: Remove Obvious Breaking Changes (Before First Build)

Make these changes FIRST, before running any build or dev server:

**A. Remove All Route Segment Config Exports**
```bash
# Find all Route Segment Config exports
grep -r "export const dynamic\|export const revalidate\|export const fetchCache" app/
```

For each file found, remove these exports and add migration comments:
```typescript
// MIGRATED: Removed export const dynamic = 'force-static' (incompatible with Cache Components)
// MIGRATED: Removed export const revalidate = 3600 (incompatible with Cache Components)
// TODO: Will add "use cache" + cacheLife() after analyzing build errors
```

**Keep these exports if found:**
- `export const runtime = 'edge'` - Still supported
- Remove `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` - Default, not needed

**B. Remove All unstable_noStore() Calls**
```bash
# Find all unstable_noStore usage
grep -r "unstable_noStore" app/ src/
```

For each file found, remove the calls and imports:
```typescript
// Remove: import { unstable_noStore } from 'next/cache'
// Remove: unstable_noStore()

// MIGRATED: Removed unstable_noStore() - dynamic by default with Cache Components
// TODO: Will add "use cache" or Suspense boundary after analyzing build errors
```

**Why do this first?**
- These changes are guaranteed to be needed
- Removes noise from build output
- Makes subsequent error messages clearer
- Build will show what actually needs Suspense/"use cache" directives

### Step 2: Run Build with Debug Prerender (Capture All Issues)

After removing obvious breaking changes, run the build to see ALL errors:

```bash
# First attempt with debug-prerender flag (best output)
<pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
```

If `--debug-prerender` is not supported:
```bash
# Fallback to standard build
<pkg-manager> run build
```

**What to capture from build output:**
- ✅ All failing routes listed
- ✅ Explicit error messages for each route
- ✅ Error types (blocking route, dynamic value, unavailable API, etc.)
- ✅ Stack traces showing exact file and line numbers
- ✅ Which routes succeeded vs failed

**Build output will show errors like:**
```
Route "/dashboard": A component accessed data, headers, params, searchParams, 
or a short-lived cache without a Suspense boundary nor a "use cache" above it.

Route "/blog/[slug]": Dynamic value detected during prerender

Route "/api/users": Cannot use cookies() inside a cached function
```

**Document all errors** - you'll fix them in Step 3.

### Step 3: Fix Errors Based on Build Output

Now fix errors iteratively, using the error messages from Step 2.

**Sub-step A: Fix All Obvious Errors**

Review the build output from Step 2 and fix all errors that have clear solutions:

- **"A component accessed data... without a Suspense boundary"** → Add `<Suspense>` or `"use cache"`
- **"Dynamic value detected during prerender"** → Add `await connection()`
- **"Cannot use cookies() inside a cached function"** → Move outside cache or use `"use cache: private"`
- **"Route params need generateStaticParams"** → Add `generateStaticParams`
- Any other error with an obvious fix from the error message

**Special Case: 3rd Party Package Errors**

If you see errors originating from packages in `node_modules/`:

**📖 For complete 3rd party package workaround examples, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to the **"Cache Components Examples"** → **"3rd Party Package Workarounds"** section for:
- Workaround 1: Wrap in Suspense Boundary
- Workaround 2: Dynamic Import
- Workaround 3: Move to Separate Dynamic Component
- Complete code examples for each approach

**Quick Reference:**

1. **Document the issue** with standardized comment format
2. **Try workarounds** (in order of preference):
   - Wrap component using the package in Suspense boundary
   - Use dynamic import to load package only when needed
   - Move package usage to separate dynamic component
   - Check for Cache Components-compatible version
3. **If no workaround works:**
   - Document with comment
   - List in final report
   - Consider filing issue with package maintainer

Fix ALL obvious errors (including documented 3rd party issues) before proceeding to Sub-step B.

**Sub-step B: Verify Obvious Fixes with Build**

After fixing all obvious errors, re-run the build to verify:

```bash
<pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
```

**Expected outcomes:**
- ✅ **All routes pass** → Success! Proceed to final verification
- ⚠️ **Some routes still fail with clear errors** → Return to Sub-step A, fix those errors
- ❌ **Some routes fail with unclear errors** → Proceed to Sub-step C

**Sub-step C: Use Dev Server for Unclear Errors**

If there are errors that are unclear from build output, start the dev server:

```bash
# Start dev server with MCP enabled
__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> dev
```

For each unclear error:
1. Navigate to the failing route using browser_eval
2. Check console errors and component behavior in real-time
3. Use Next.js MCP `get_errors` tool to see detailed error information
4. Make fixes with Fast Refresh for instant feedback
5. Verify the route loads correctly

**Sub-step D: Final Build Verification**

After fixing unclear errors with dev server, run the build again:

```bash
<pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
```

**Repeat until build passes with 0 errors.**

**Workflow Summary:**
```
Step 1: Remove obvious breaking changes (exports, unstable_noStore)
  ↓
Step 2: Build to capture all errors
  ↓
Step 3A: Fix ALL obvious errors from build output
  ↓
Step 3B: Re-run build to verify fixes
  ↓
  ├─ All pass? → Success! Go to final verification
  ├─ Clear errors remain? → Back to Step 3A
  └─ Unclear errors remain? → Step 3C
        ↓
Step 3C: Use dev server + MCP for unclear errors only
  ↓
Step 3D: Re-run build to verify
  ↓
Final: All routes build successfully (0 errors)
```

**What This Phase Accomplishes:**

This phase handles ALL code changes needed for Cache Components:
- ✅ Remove Route Segment Config exports (Step 1)
- ✅ Remove unstable_noStore() calls (Step 1)
- ✅ Add Suspense boundaries for dynamic content (Step 3)
- ✅ Add "use cache" directives for cacheable content (Step 3)
- ✅ Fix dynamic value errors with connection() (Step 3)
- ✅ Add generateStaticParams for route params (Step 3)
- ✅ Set up cache tags with cacheTag() for revalidation (Step 3)
- ✅ Configure cacheLife profiles for fine-grained control (Step 3)
- ✅ Move unavailable APIs outside cache scope (Step 3)

**Critical: Apply the Decision Guide for Every Fix**

For each error in Step 3, before applying a fix:

1. **Analyze:** Use the Decision Guide questions
   - Is content the same for all users?
   - How often does it change?
   - Does it use user-specific data?
   - Can it be revalidated on-demand?

2. **Ask Human for Ambiguous Cases**
   - **ALWAYS ask the human** when uncertain about caching decisions
   - Edge cases: Infrequently changing content (yearly, monthly)
   - Business logic: Unknown update frequency
   - Tradeoffs: Performance vs freshness unclear

3. **Decide:** Choose the appropriate approach
   - Cache it (static) with `"use cache"`
   - Make it dynamic with `<Suspense>`
   - Mix both (hybrid)
   - Use `"use cache: private"` for prefetchable user content

4. **Document:** Always add comments explaining your decision
   - Include human input if applicable ("HUMAN INPUT: ...")
   - Why you chose to cache or not cache
   - Expected update frequency
   - How content will be revalidated

5. **Implement:** Apply the fix with proper configuration
   - Add `cacheLife()` based on content change frequency
   - Add `cacheTag()` if there's a clear revalidation trigger
   - Add descriptive comments with human decisions noted

Fix errors systematically based on error type. For code examples and detailed patterns, refer to the loaded knowledge resources above.

**Fixing Common Error Types:**

For detailed code examples and patterns for each error type, refer to the knowledge resources loaded above:
- Error-Patterns resource: Common Cache Components errors and their solutions
- Advanced-Patterns resource: cacheLife(), cacheTag(), and optimization strategies

**Key Fix Types:**
- A. Blocking route errors → Add Suspense boundary or "use cache"
- B. Dynamic values → Use connection() or extract to separate component
- C. Route params → Add generateStaticParams
- D. Unavailable APIs in cache → Move outside cache scope or use "use cache: private"
- E. Route Segment Config → Remove ALL exports and migrate to Cache Components patterns
  - `export const dynamic` → Remove, add `"use cache"` or `<Suspense>` + migration comment
  - `export const revalidate` → Remove, use `cacheLife()` with appropriate profile
  - `export const fetchCache` → Remove, use `"use cache"` if needed
  - `export const runtime = 'edge'` → Keep if needed (edge runtime is still supported)
  - `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` → Remove (nodejs is the default, no need to specify)
  - `export const preferredRegion` → Keep value but remove the export const
  - `export const dynamicParams` → Remove, use `generateStaticParams` instead
  - **Always add migration comments** to document what was removed
- F. unstable_noStore Removal → Remove all `unstable_noStore()` calls
  - `unstable_noStore()` → Remove completely (dynamic is now the default)
  - No replacement needed - Cache Components makes everything dynamic by default
  - If you want to cache specific content, use `"use cache"` instead
  - **Add migration comment** explaining the removal
- G. Caching strategies → Configure cacheLife() and cacheTag()

### Removing unstable_noStore() Usage

**CRITICAL: unstable_noStore() is incompatible with Cache Components**

The `unstable_noStore()` API was used in the old caching model to opt-out of static rendering. With Cache Components, this API is no longer needed because:

1. **Everything is dynamic by default** - No need to opt-out of caching
2. **Use "use cache" to opt-in** - The paradigm is reversed
3. **unstable_noStore() causes errors** - Will break Cache Components behavior

**📖 For complete migration patterns and code examples, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to the **"unstable_noStore Examples"** section for:
- Basic removal (keep dynamic)
- Migration with Suspense boundary
- Migration to cached content
- Complete before/after examples
- Hybrid approach patterns

**Quick Migration Steps:**

1. **Search for usage:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "unstable_noStore" app/ src/
   ```

2. **Remove the import and calls:**
   ```typescript
   // Remove: import { unstable_noStore } from 'next/cache';
   // Remove: unstable_noStore();
   ```

3. **Add migration comment:**
   ```typescript
   // MIGRATED: Removed unstable_noStore() - dynamic by default with Cache Components
   ```

4. **Choose migration path:**
   - **Keep dynamic (most common):** No changes needed - already dynamic by default
   - **Add Suspense:** Wrap in `<Suspense>` for better UX with loading states
   - **Cache instead:** Add `"use cache"` if content should actually be cached

5. **Load the resource for detailed examples** specific to your use case

### Importing and Commenting cacheLife() and cacheTag() - Let Users Decide

**IMPORTANT: Always Include Imports with Decision Comments**

**📖 For complete caching strategy examples and comment templates, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to the **"Cache Components Examples"** section for:
- **cacheLife() and cacheTag() Comment Templates** - Full template pattern
- **Caching Strategy Examples** - All 5 strategies (A, B, C, D, E) with complete code
- **Hybrid Caching Patterns** - Mix cached and dynamic content
- **Private Cache Examples** - Using "use cache: private"

**Quick Reference - Comment Template Pattern:**

When adding `"use cache"` to any component, include commented import templates:

```
// ⚠️ CACHING STRATEGY DECISION NEEDED:
// Uncomment ONE of the following based on your needs:
// Option A: Time-based revalidation - cacheLife('hours')
// Option B: Tag-based revalidation - cacheTag('resource-name')
// Option C: Long-term caching - cacheLife('max')
// Option D: Short-lived cache - cacheLife('minutes')
// Option E: Custom profile - cacheLife({ stale, revalidate, expire })
```

**When to use each strategy:**
- **Strategy A (Time-based):** Content changes on predictable schedules (most common)
- **Strategy B (Tag-based):** Content updates unpredictably (admin actions, CMS events)
- **Strategy C (Long-term):** Truly immutable content (historical data, archives)
- **Strategy D (Short-lived):** Frequently updating content (dashboards, live data)
- **Strategy E (Custom):** Advanced use cases with specific timing needs

**Load the MCP resource for detailed examples and complete code for each strategy.**

**Migration Checklist - cacheLife/cacheTag:**

For EVERY component/function with `"use cache"`:

- [ ] **Review imports:** Are `cacheLife` and/or `cacheTag` imports commented but visible?
- [ ] **User decision:** Has someone decided which revalidation strategy to use?
- [ ] **Configuration:** Is the chosen strategy uncommented and configured?
- [ ] **Documentation:** Does the code comment explain WHY this strategy was chosen?
- [ ] **Testing:** Have you verified the cache behavior matches expectations?

**Red Flags - cacheLife/cacheTag Issues:**

- ❌ **`"use cache"` without any cacheLife/cacheTag:** Will cache forever by default - decide intentionally
- ❌ **cacheLife configured but no comment:** Future developers won't know why this value was chosen
- ❌ **Multiple conflicting cacheTag calls:** May cause unexpected revalidation behavior
- ❌ **cacheTag on non-revalidatable routes:** Tag-based revalidation won't work on static routes
- ❌ **Very short revalidation times:** (< 30 seconds) - Consider if caching helps performance at all

### Special Case: Handling `new Date()` and `Math.random()` in Cache Components

**📖 For complete guidance on handling dynamic values in cached components, load:**
```
Read resource "nextjs16://migration/examples"
```

Then navigate to **"Cache Components Examples"** → **"Handling `new Date()` and `Math.random()`"** for:
- Decision framework with 3 options
- Complete code examples for each option
- Common patterns table
- Migration checklist

**Quick Reference:**

When you encounter `new Date()` or `Math.random()` in cached components, ask:
**"Should this value be captured at cache time, or fresh per-request?"**

**Three Options:**
1. **Fresh Per-Request (Recommended):** Use `"use cache: private"` - always fresh
2. **Captured at Cache Time:** Use `"use cache"` - frozen until revalidation (document tradeoff)
3. **Extract to Separate Component:** Mix static (cached) + dynamic (Suspense)

**Load the MCP resource for detailed examples and complete migration patterns.**

**Handling Unclear Cases That Can't Be Resolved:**

If after multiple attempts a fix continues to fail or the issue is unclear, leave a comment documenting the problem:

**For 3rd party packages (use the 3RD PARTY PACKAGE ISSUE format):**
```typescript
// ⚠️ 3RD PARTY PACKAGE ISSUE: payment-gateway-sdk@2.1.0
// Error: Package uses internal async provider pattern that blocks routes
// Source: node_modules/payment-gateway-sdk/dist/index.js
// Workaround attempted: Suspense boundary, dynamic import, "use cache: private"
// Status: Cannot fix - requires package update
// Recommendation: Check for Cache Components-compatible version or alternative package
// TODO: Monitor package updates or switch to alternative-payment-sdk
```

**For other unclear cases (custom code, complex patterns):**
```typescript
// ⚠️ UNRESOLVED: Unable to determine caching strategy for this component
// Issue: [describe the unclear behavior]
// Error: [specific error that persists]
// Recommendation: [what should be investigated]
// TODO: [action items or conditions for revisiting]
```

**Common Unclear Cases:**
- **3rd party packages** with incompatible internal implementations (use 3RD PARTY PACKAGE ISSUE format above)
- Third-party components with unknown/complex internal state management
- Components using undocumented async patterns
- External library integrations with unclear rendering behavior
- Timing-dependent code that behaves differently in cache vs runtime

**When to Leave These Comments:**
1. You've tried multiple caching strategies (cache, Suspense, private cache)
2. All attempts result in the same error or unexpected behavior
3. The root cause is unclear (third-party code, complex state, etc.)
4. You've verified the error isn't due to missing Suspense/cache directives
5. The component works but you can't determine the appropriate caching mode

**IMPORTANT: For 3rd party package issues:**
- Always use the "3RD PARTY PACKAGE ISSUE" format
- Include package name and version
- Document attempted workarounds
- List the issue in Phase 5 output section "G. 3rd Party Package Issues"
- Include in final report table

**Example Scenarios:**
```typescript
// ⚠️ 3RD PARTY PACKAGE ISSUE: analytics-dashboard@4.2.1
// Error: Component works in dev but different behavior in build prerender
// Source: node_modules/analytics-dashboard/dist/Dashboard.js
// Workaround attempted: Suspense boundary - partially works
// Status: Partially resolved - some features disabled
// Recommendation: Contact package maintainer about Cache Components support
// TODO: Upgrade when analytics-dashboard@5.0 releases with CC support

// ⚠️ UNRESOLVED: Custom animation timing issue
// Issue: Animation component behaves differently in cache vs runtime
// Error: Cached value inconsistent between prerender and runtime
// Recommendation: Investigate hydration mismatch, may need "use cache: private"
// TODO: Profile in production build to understand timing behavior
```

This allows the codebase to be functional while clearly marking areas needing future investigation and tracking 3rd party compatibility issues separately.

**Continue until:**
- All routes return 200 OK
- `get_errors` returns no errors
- No console warnings related to Cache Components
- All fixes have explanatory comments

**Verification Strategy After All Fixes:**

After completing Step 3 and fixing all errors, verify with a final build:

```bash
# Final verification build
<pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ All routes build successfully
- ✅ Build output shows proper cache status for each route
- ✅ No "blocking route" or "dynamic value" errors

**If final build still has errors:**
- Review build output for remaining issues
- Fix any missed errors following Step 3 process
- Re-run build until all errors are resolved

**Optional: Dev Server Verification**

If you want to verify routes interactively:
```bash
# Start dev server
__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> dev
```

Then:
- Navigate to key routes in browser
- Verify dynamic content loads correctly
- Test cached content behavior
- Confirm Fast Refresh works with changes

**Important:**
- Build verification is the primary success criterion
- Dev server verification is optional but helpful for testing dynamic behavior
- Every fix should include comments explaining the decision

## PHASE 6: Final Verification
────────────────────────────────────────

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ All fixes applied in Phase 5
- ✅ Dev server is still running
- ✅ All routes verified with get_errors

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Load verification resource**

You MUST load:
```
ReadMcpResourceTool(server="next-devtools", uri="nextjs16://knowledge/build-behavior")
```

This provides build verification strategies and troubleshooting guidance.

Run comprehensive checks:

1. **All Routes Final Test**
   With dev server still running:
   - Request all routes one final time
   - Verify all return successfully (200 OK)
   - Call get_errors one last time via MCP
   - Expected: Empty error list

2. **Stop Dev Server**
   Now that development verification is complete:
   ```bash
   # Stop the background dev server process
   # (You can now safely stop it)
   ```

3. **Build Test with Debug Prerender**
   ```bash
   # First, attempt with debug-prerender flag if available
   <pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender
   ```

   If `--debug-prerender` is not supported:
   ```bash
   # Fallback to standard build
   <pkg-manager> run build
   ```

   Expected:
   - Build succeeds without errors
   - Build output shows cache status for each route
   - With `--debug-prerender`: Detailed prerender diagnostics and cache analysis
   - Check for any build-time errors that didn't appear in dev
   - All routes prerendered or marked as dynamic correctly

4. **Dev Mode Test**
   ```bash
   __NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_SERVER=true <pkg-manager> next dev
   # Test a few key routes in dev mode
   ```
   Expected:
   - Server starts successfully
   - Key routes work correctly
   - Cached content behavior can be observed

## Important Caching Behavior Notes
────────────────────────────────────────

### Memory Cache vs Persistent Cache

**Self-Hosting (Long-Running Server):**
- `"use cache"` entries saved in memory
- Available for subsequent requests within same process
- Lost when server restarts

**Vercel / Serverless:**
- NO memory cache between requests (lambda is ephemeral)
- `"use cache"` only effective if included in prerendered fallback shell
- If cached content is in same Suspense boundary as blocking content, it won't be in shell
- For persistent cache between requests, use `"use cache: remote"` to store in Vercel Data Cache (VDC)

**Key Implication:**
If you see a cached component re-executing on every request:
1. Check if there's blocking async IO in the same Suspense boundary
2. Either: Wrap blocking content in its own Suspense boundary
3. Or: Use `"use cache: remote"` for VDC storage

### Prefetching Behavior

**Production Only:**
- Link prefetching ONLY works in production (`npm run build && npm start`)
- In development, prefetching is disabled
- Test prefetching in production build before deploying

**What Gets Prefetched:**
- Static shells for routes with `<Link>` components in viewport
- Only NEW static content (not already in cache)
- Full cached components (with `"use cache"`)
- `"use cache: private"` content can be prefetched with runtime values (cookies, params, searchParams)

### Static Shell Storage

**Build Output:**
- Saved in `.next` directory during build
- Served as static assets (self-hosting)
- Stored in ISR cache on Vercel (globally distributed to edge)

**Partial Revalidation:**
- Can be revalidated without full rebuilds
- Using `revalidateTag` or `revalidatePath`
- Based on `cacheLife` revalidate/expire times

## Migration Notes
[Any special notes about the migration, especially if migrating from PPR]

## Complete Changes Summary
This enablement process made the following comprehensive changes:

### Configuration Changes (Phase 2):
- ✅ Enabled cacheComponents (location depends on version)
- ✅ Removed incompatible flags (ppr, dynamicIO)
- ✅ Preserved compatible flags
- ✅ Documented Route Segment Config

### Boundary & Cache Setup (Phase 5):
- ✅ Added Suspense boundaries for dynamic content
- ✅ Added "use cache" directives for cacheable content
- ✅ Added "use cache: private" for prefetchable private content
- ✅ Created loading.tsx files where appropriate
- ✅ Added generateStaticParams for dynamic routes

### API Migrations (Phase 5):
- ✅ Moved cookies()/headers() calls outside cache scope
- ✅ Handled dynamic values (connection(), "use cache" with cacheLife, or Suspense as appropriate)
- ✅ Migrated Route Segment Config to "use cache" + cacheLife
- ✅ Removed all export const dynamic/revalidate/fetchCache

### Cache Optimization (Phase 5):
- ✅ Added cacheTag() calls for granular revalidation
- ✅ Configured cacheLife profiles for revalidation control
- ✅ Set up cache invalidation strategies

## Next Steps
- Monitor application behavior in development
- Test interactive features with Cache Components
- Review cacheLife profile usage for optimization
- Test prefetching in production build
- Consider enabling Turbopack file system caching for faster dev
- Monitor cache hit rates and adjust cacheLife profiles

## Troubleshooting Tips
- If cached components re-execute on every request: Check Suspense boundaries, consider "use cache: remote"
- If prefetching doesn't work: Test in production build, not dev mode
- If routes still show blocking errors: Look for parent Suspense or add "use cache"
- If "use cache" with params fails: Add generateStaticParams
- If dynamic APIs fail in cache: Move outside cache scope or use "use cache: private"
- If Route Segment Config errors: Remove exports, use "use cache" + cacheLife instead

## What Was Accomplished
Cache Components is now fully enabled with:
- ✅ Configuration flags properly set
- ✅ All routes verified and working
- ✅ All boundaries properly configured
- ✅ All cache directives in place
- ✅ All API migrations completed
- ✅ Cache optimization strategies implemented
- ✅ Zero errors in final verification
- ✅ Production build tested and passing

## 3rd Party Package Issues & Recommendations

**Packages with Cache Components Compatibility Issues:**
[If any 3rd party package issues were encountered, list them here]

| Package | Version | Issue | Workaround | Status | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|-------|------------|--------|----------------|
| [package-name] | [version] | [error description] | [workaround applied] | [Resolved/Cannot fix] | [Upgrade/Replace/Report issue] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Actions Needed:**
- [ ] Monitor package updates for Cache Components compatibility
- [ ] Consider filing issues with package maintainers
- [ ] Document workarounds for team reference
- [ ] Plan to replace packages if no fix is available

**If no 3rd party package issues:** ✅ All packages are compatible with Cache Components
```

# START HERE
Begin Cache Components enablement:

## Recommended Workflow (Build-First Approach)

1. **Phase 1:** Pre-flight checks
2. **Phase 2:** Enable Cache Components in config
3. **Phase 5 - Step 1:** Remove critical breaking changes FIRST
   - Remove all Route Segment Config exports (dynamic, revalidate, fetchCache)
   - Remove all unstable_noStore() calls
   - These will definitely error, so remove before building
4. **Phase 5 - Step 2:** Run build with --debug-prerender
   - `<pkg-manager> run build -- --debug-prerender`
   - Capture ALL error messages from build output
   - Document failing routes and error types
5. **Phase 5 - Step 3A:** Fix ALL obvious errors from build output
   - Review error messages, fix all errors with clear solutions
   - Don't start dev server yet
6. **Phase 5 - Step 3B:** Verify fixes with build
   - Re-run build to verify all obvious errors are fixed
   - If clear errors remain, go back to Step 3A
   - If all pass, go to final verification
   - If unclear errors remain, proceed to Step 3C
7. **Phase 5 - Step 3C:** (Only if needed) Use dev server for unclear errors
   - Start dev server with MCP enabled
   - Navigate to failing routes, investigate with browser
   - Fix unclear errors using Fast Refresh
8. **Phase 5 - Step 3D:** Final build verification
   - Re-run build to ensure all errors fixed
9. **Phase 6:** Final verification and cleanup

**Why This Workflow Works Best:**

✅ **Step 1 removes guaranteed breaking changes** - Clean slate before first build
✅ **Step 2 shows ALL errors at once** - Complete picture of what needs fixing
✅ **Step 3A fixes obvious errors first** - Batch fix from build output
✅ **Step 3B verifies with build** - Ensure fixes work before moving on
✅ **Step 3C uses dev server only for unclear cases** - Not needed for most errors
✅ **Faster overall** - Fewer iteration cycles, clearer error messages, no unnecessary dev server

## Alternative Workflow (Dev Server First)

If you prefer to see errors in real-time or have a very large project:

1. Phase 1: Pre-flight checks
2. Phase 2: Enable config
3. Phase 3: Start dev server with MCP (**ONCE, DO NOT RESTART**)
4. Phase 4: Verify routes and collect errors (optional)
5. Phase 5: Fix with Fast Refresh
6. Phase 6: Final verification

**Critical Rules for Alternative Workflow:**
- **NEVER restart the dev server** - Start once, let Fast Refresh handle changes
- Use get_errors MCP tool to catch issues early

**The goal:** Zero errors and all routes working with Cache Components enabled
